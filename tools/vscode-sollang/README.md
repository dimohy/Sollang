# Sollang Language Support

VS Code language support for Sollang `.slg` files.

## Features

- Registers `.slg` as `sollang`.
- Highlights comments, interpolated strings, indentation-normalized raw multiline
  strings, declarations (`struct`, nested `struct`, `enum`, `effect`, `trait`,
  `impl`), generics, async/effect clauses, receiver-only and parenthesized flow
  calls, bindings, owned values, compile-time ranges, arrays, dictionaries,
  memory mapping, fixed-width integer and floating-point types, Result
  propagation, loop controls, namespaces, imports, and operators.
- Adds Sollang-only default token colors for comments, strings, variables,
  parameters, keywords, types, namespaces, constants, numbers, operators, and
  punctuation while leaving function colors to the active VS Code theme.
- Adds indentation and bracket pairing for `{}`, `[]`, `()`, and `"`.
- Provides snippets for `main`, functions, async functions, structs, enums,
  trait implementations, raw multiline strings, flow calls, `each`, `repeat`,
  `fold`, `when`, mutable bindings, interpolation, namespaces, and imports.
