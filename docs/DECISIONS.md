# SmallLang Decision Log

This file records accepted or working decisions so the language design can
evolve without losing context.

## D001 - Specification Before Implementation

Status: accepted
Date: 2026-07-07

SmallLang remains in specification mode until the user explicitly asks for
implementation. No compiler, parser, LLVM backend, runtime, or build
infrastructure should be created before that.

## D002 - Compiler Implementation Stack

Status: accepted
Date: 2026-07-07

When implementation begins, the compiler should use the latest .NET and latest
C# Preview features unless a later constraint requires otherwise. Actual SDK,
C# language, and LLVM versions must be verified against official sources before
implementation starts.

## D003 - Native LLVM Output

Status: accepted
Date: 2026-07-07

SmallLang compiles through LLVM and ultimately produces highly optimized native
executables. The language and compiler pipeline should be designed around
efficient LLVM lowering rather than treating LLVM as an afterthought.

## D004 - First Program Syntax

Status: working decision
Date: 2026-07-07

The first complete SmallLang program is:

```smalllang
main {
    name = "dimohy"
    print("Hello, {name}")
}
```

The `main` block is explicit, short, and parser-friendly. `name = value` is the
initial local binding form. Full function syntax is not decided yet.

## D005 - `print` As Platform-Bound Primitive

Status: working decision
Date: 2026-07-07

`print` appears as a simple prelude call in source code, but resolves internally
to `core.io.print` and lowers to a platform-specific stdout backend selected by
the target triple.

The design must preserve:

- simple source syntax
- cross-platform correctness
- Unicode-correct Windows console behavior
- efficient static string output
- no silent fallback for unsupported targets
- explicit handling of output failure

## D006 - Bindings Without Declaration Keywords

Status: working decision
Date: 2026-07-07

Local variables are introduced with the smallest readable form:

```smalllang
name = "dimohy"
```

There is no `let`, `var`, or declaration keyword in the initial syntax. For now,
the first `name = expression` in a block introduces a binding, and reusing the
same name in the same scope is a compile-time error. Reassignment and mutability
remain open design questions.

## D007 - Minimal String Interpolation

Status: working decision
Date: 2026-07-07

Double-quoted strings support simple binding/path interpolation:

```smalllang
"Hello, {name}"
```

The initial interpolation form accepts names and reserved path syntax only, not
arbitrary expressions. This keeps tokenization, parsing, semantic analysis, and
LLVM lowering simple while still making the first useful program expressive.

## D008 - Local LLVM Bootstrap

Status: accepted
Date: 2026-07-07

LLVM binaries must not be committed to the repository. The build script
downloads LLVM 22.1.8 into `.tools` when missing and uses that local toolchain
for native code generation. `.tools`, `artifacts`, and build outputs are ignored
by Git.

## D009 - First Native Backend

Status: working decision
Date: 2026-07-07

The first native backend targets Windows x64 and links with `lld-link` without
the C runtime. The generated executable imports only `GetStdHandle` and
`WriteFile` from `kernel32.dll` for the first `print` program. The verified
first executable size is 752 bytes.

## D010 - Modular Compiler Source Layout

Status: accepted
Date: 2026-07-07

Even small requests should keep the compiler modular. The compiler source is
split by responsibility into CLI, Lexing, Parsing, Syntax, Semantics, CodeGen,
and Tooling modules. `Program.cs` must stay as a minimal entry point, not a
container for lexer/parser/codegen/linker implementation.

## D011 - Lexer Source Generation From SmallLang Rules

Status: accepted
Date: 2026-07-07

SmallLang lexer rules are expressed in `syntax/smalllang.lexer`. A Roslyn incremental
source generator in `src/SmallLang.Compiler.Generators` reads that rules file and
generates `TokenKind` and `Lexer` during compiler build. This keeps the language
surface concise and regular while producing deterministic C# tokenization code.

## D012 - Parser Source Generation From SmallLang Grammar

Status: accepted
Date: 2026-07-07

SmallLang parser rules are expressed in `syntax/smalllang.grammar`. A Roslyn incremental
source generator reads that grammar file as an MSBuild `AdditionalFiles` input
and emits the current token-to-AST parser during compiler build.

ANTLR, parser combinators, and C# embedded parser generators remain valid future
options, but they are not the best fit for the first SmallLang slice. ANTLR adds a
separate grammar toolchain and C# runtime dependency. Parser combinators and
attribute-based C# parser generators keep grammar inside C# code instead of a
small language-owned syntax file. The current source-generator approach keeps
the repo small, dependency-light, modular, and aligned with the existing lexer
generation model.

The first parser generator intentionally supports only the approved initial
grammar shape. Broader grammar features should be added when the language
surface actually needs them.

## D013 - Value-Flow Calls As Preferred Call Style

Status: implemented, superseded in parser shape by D016
Date: 2026-07-07

SmallLang adopts `value -> function()` as the preferred call style when a primary
input value flows into a function:

```smalllang
"Hello, {name}" -> print()
```

This form makes data flow visually explicit. The expression on the left is the
first input to the callable path on the right. For the initial unary case, it is
semantically equivalent to:

```smalllang
print("Hello, {name}")
```

Parenthesized calls remain valid as a conventional compatibility syntax and for
cases where the value-flow form is not expressive enough. The preferred SmallLang
style is value-flow first:

```smalllang
result = value -> transform
```

Function type notation should use the same left-to-right direction:

```smalllang
print: Text -> Io<Unit>
```

The first implementation lowered unary value-flow calls to the same call AST
shape used by the existing parenthesized call. D016 keeps value-flow as its own
AST node so a final target can bind the result.

## D014 - Initial Integer Addition And Scalar Interpolation

Status: accepted
Date: 2026-07-07

SmallLang supports decimal integer literals and left-associative integer `+` in the
current compiler slice:

```smalllang
sum = 20 + 22
```

The first numeric model is intentionally narrow. Integer literals evaluate to
signed 64-bit values in the semantic evaluator, and `+` performs checked integer
addition. Mixed string/integer `+`, floating point values, arbitrary precision
numbers, suffixes, and final overflow policy syntax are not decided yet.

String interpolation can display integer bindings:

```smalllang
"Number: {sum}" -> print()
```

This first numeric step initially allowed the compiler to fold the whole sample
to output bytes. D015 changes the current sample to exercise runtime function
calls and runtime integer-to-decimal output instead.

## D015 - Runtime Function Sample

Status: implemented, superseded as the current sample by D016
Date: 2026-07-07

The D015 sample should not be represented only as one compile-time output
buffer. It used zero-argument functions so the generated LLVM contained real
runtime calls:

```smalllang
getName: -> Text {
    "dimohy"
}

getNum: -> Int {
    20 + 22
}

main {
    name = getName()
    num = getNum()
    "Hello, {name}. getNum() = {num}" -> print()
}
```

The D015 implementation parsed `getName: -> Text { ... }` and
`getNum: -> Int { ... }` as zero-argument expression functions. Semantic
analysis type-checks the function bodies and main bindings. The Windows LLVM
backend emits `@smalllang_fn_getName`, `@smalllang_fn_getNum`, runtime `i64` addition,
segmented `WriteFile` output, and a runtime integer decimal conversion helper
instead of one full static output string. D016 is the current sample and
supersedes the `getNum` naming.

## D016 - Flow Binding And One-Input Square Function

Status: implemented, superseded by D036
Date: 2026-07-07

SmallLang adopts statement-level value-flow binding for the current sample:

```smalllang
getName: -> Text {
    "dimohy"
}

square: Int -> Int {
    it * it
}

main {
    getName() -> name
    7 -> square() -> num
    "Hello, {name}. square = {num}" -> print()
}
```

`getName() -> name` calls the zero-input function and binds its result to `name`.
`7 -> square() -> num` passes `7` into a one-input function, where the implicit
input binding is named `it`, then binds the returned value to `num`.

The parser now preserves value-flow as `FlowExpression` rather than immediately
lowering it to `CallExpression`. Semantic analysis resolves each target as a
known one-input function, `print`, or a final statement-level binding target.
Unknown intermediate targets are compile-time errors, and flow expression
statements must either end in `print` or bind their result.

The current implementation adds the `*` token/operator, parses
`square: Int -> Int { it * it }`, emits `@smalllang_fn_square(i64 %it)`, lowers the
body to `mul nsw i64 %it, %it`, and calls it as `@smalllang_fn_square(i64 7)`.
The verified output at D016 time was `Hello, dimohy. square = 49`; the Windows
x64 executable size at D016 time remained 1,088 bytes.

## D017 - Input Primitive And Inclusive Range Loop

Status: implemented, loop spelling superseded by D019
Date: 2026-07-08

SmallLang samples are cumulative. New samples should be added alongside earlier
samples instead of replacing `examples/01-function-basic-hello.sl`.

The next implemented sample reads an integer and prints that multiplication
table:

```smalllang
main {
    "n = ? " -> readInt() -> n

    each i in 1..9 {
        n * i -> value
        "{n} x {i} = {value}" -> println()
    }
}
```

`readInt` mirrors output value-flow style: a `Text` prompt flows into the input
primitive and the resulting `Int` can flow into a binding target. The
parenthesized form `readInt("n = ? ")` remains valid. Internally, `readInt`
resolves to a selected backend primitive, currently the Windows stdin path using
`ReadFile`; this keeps the source syntax independent from the platform backend
and leaves room for POSIX/WASI input lowering later.

`println` is accepted as the first newline-output convenience. It shares the
same output backend as `print`, then emits one line-feed byte in the current
runtime slice.

The first loop syntax is:

```smalllang
each i in 1..9 {
    ...
}
```

This is an inclusive integer range loop. The loop variable is scoped to the loop
body, and bindings created inside the body do not escape the body. The current
implementation lowers the loop to LLVM basic blocks with an SSA phi value for
the loop variable. Descending ranges are not specified yet; a range whose start
is greater than its end executes zero times.

After adding the input and loop runtime, the verified executable sizes are 1,104
bytes for `examples/01-function-basic-hello.sl` and 1,584 bytes for
`examples/07-block-each-explicit-item.sl`.

## D018 - Arrow Binding As Preferred Assignment Direction

Status: accepted
Date: 2026-07-08

SmallLang should prefer arrow-oriented binding even for local assignment-like
introductions. New samples should use:

```smalllang
expression -> name
n * i -> value
```

instead of leading with:

```smalllang
name = expression
value = n * i
```

This keeps local binding aligned with the language's value-flow direction:
values are written first, then flow into their binding target. The existing
`name = expression` form remains accepted as a compatibility syntax for now, but
it is no longer the preferred style for examples or documentation. This decision
supersedes D004/D006 as the current surface-language direction while preserving
those entries as historical context.

## D019 - Arrow Range Loop With Optional Item Name

Status: superseded by D036
Date: 2026-07-08

SmallLang's preferred range loop syntax is now flow-oriented:

```smalllang
1..9 -> each i {
    n * i -> value
    "{n} x {i} = {value}" -> println()
}
```

The range expression flows into `each`, and the optional identifier after `each`
names the current item. When the identifier is omitted, the loop item is bound as
`it`:

```smalllang
1..9 -> each {
    n * it -> value
    "{n} x {it} = {value}" -> println()
}
```

This gives the language two final current forms:

- `start..end -> each { ... }` for the default item binding `it`
- `start..end -> each item { ... }` for an explicit item binding

The older `each item in start..end { ... }` spelling remains accepted as a
compatibility form, but new samples and documentation should prefer the
flow-oriented loop syntax.

## D020 - Optional Function Input Names

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-08

SmallLang one-input functions now follow the same naming shape as `each`.

When the input name is omitted, the function body receives the value as `it`:

```smalllang
square: Int -> Int {
    it * it
}
```

When the input name is supplied after the function name, the body receives the
value through that binding:

```smalllang
square n: Int -> Int {
    n * n
}
```

This mirrors the loop forms:

```smalllang
1..9 -> each {
    it
}

1..9 -> each i {
    i
}
```

The older `square: Int -> Int { it * it }` form remains valid and is the default
input-binding form. The explicit form `square n: Int -> Int { n * n }` is
available when naming the input improves readability.

## D021 - Built-In Block Functions And Optimized `each`

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-08

`each` should be understood as the first built-in block function rather than as
only a hard-coded loop statement:

```smalllang
1..9 -> each i {
    n * i -> value
    "{n} x {i} = {value}" -> println()
}
```

Semantically, the range value flows into the block function `each`, `i` names the
block invocation input, and the brace body is the executable block argument.
The default item form follows the same rule:

```smalllang
1..9 -> each {
    n * it -> value
    "{n} x {it} = {value}" -> println()
}
```

The compiler now represents this preferred form as a generic block-function call
AST. The current semantic layer only accepts `each` as a block-function target;
future built-ins or user-defined block functions can build on the same model.

This language model must not force inefficient runtime lowering. The Windows
LLVM backend specializes the built-in `each` block function directly into loop
basic blocks with an SSA phi value for the item binding. It does not allocate a
closure, emit a function pointer, or perform dynamic block dispatch for the
current built-in loop.

The older `each item in start..end { ... }` spelling remains accepted as a
compatibility syntax and is converted into the same internal block-function call
shape before semantic analysis.

## D022 - `sys.io` Is A SmallLang Standard Library Module

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-08

`print`, `println`, and `readInt` should not be compiler-owned special functions
under the `sys.io` name. They are ordinary functions provided by the standard
library and imported globally through aliases:

```text
print   -> sys.io.print
println -> sys.io.println
readInt -> sys.io.readInt
```

The actual `sys.io` module is implemented in SmallLang:

```smalllang
namespace sys.io

import sys.runtime as rt

print value: Text -> Unit {
    value -> rt.print()
}

println value: Text -> Unit {
    value -> rt.println()
}

readInt prompt: Text -> Int {
    prompt -> rt.readInt()
}
```

The lower runtime boundary is declared separately in the standard library with
`= intrinsic`:

```smalllang
namespace sys.runtime

print value: Text -> Unit = intrinsic
println value: Text -> Unit = intrinsic
readInt prompt: Text -> Int = intrinsic
```

This required two syntax additions for the current implementation slice:

- path-qualified function declarations, such as
  `sys.io.print value: Text -> Unit { ... }`
- intrinsic declarations, such as
  `sys.runtime.print value: Text -> Unit = intrinsic`
- namespace declarations and import aliases, such as `namespace sys.io` and
  `import sys.runtime as rt`

The compiler loads `stdlib/sys/runtime.sl` and `stdlib/sys/io.sl` before user
source, then adds only alias entries for `print`, `println`, and `readInt`.
The semantic model resolves `sys.io` through the same function table as user
functions. The Windows LLVM backend inlines standard library wrappers and lowers
only the `sys.runtime` intrinsic boundary to direct `ReadFile`/`WriteFile`
runtime code, so verified IR does not emit `sys.io` function calls.

## D023 - Local Functions Inside Functions

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-08

Function declarations may appear at the start of another function body:

```smalllang
scale n: Int -> Int {
    double value: Int -> Int {
        value * 2
    }

    addBase value: Int -> Int {
        value + n
    }

    n -> double -> addBase
}
```

Local functions use the same function input naming rules as top-level functions.
Their names are scoped to the containing function and functions nested below it;
they are not added to the global function table and cannot be called from
`main` or unrelated functions.

Local functions can read bindings from the containing function. In the sample
above, `addBase` reads the outer input binding `n`. The current Windows LLVM
backend lowers local functions by inlining their bodies at the call site, so no
global LLVM symbol is emitted for `double` or `addBase`. Recursive local
functions are not part of the current runtime slice.

## D024 - Namespace And Import Aliases For Standard Library Modules

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-08

Standard library files should not repeat their full namespace and dependency
paths on every function declaration and runtime call. SmallLang now accepts an
optional file-level namespace declaration followed by import declarations:

```smalllang
namespace sys.io

import sys.runtime as rt
```

Within a namespaced file, top-level single-segment function declarations are
qualified by that namespace:

```smalllang
print value: Text -> Unit {
    value -> rt.print()
}
```

This defines `sys.io.print`. The import alias rewrites `rt.print` to
`sys.runtime.print` before semantic analysis, so the semantic model and LLVM
lowering still work with fully qualified canonical names.

The lower runtime boundary uses the same namespace rule:

```smalllang
namespace sys.runtime

print value: Text -> Unit = intrinsic
println value: Text -> Unit = intrinsic
readInt prompt: Text -> Int = intrinsic
```

Local function declarations are not namespace-qualified. They keep the D023
scope rule and remain visible only inside the containing function.

## D025 - Linux x64 Target Through WSL

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-08

SmallLang now supports a `linux-x64` compiler target in addition to the default
`windows-x64` target:

```powershell
.\scripts\smalllang.ps1 -Source examples\01-function-basic-hello.sl -Output artifacts\01-function-basic-hello-linux -Target linux-x64 -KeepTemps
```

The compiler selects the LLVM target triple from the requested target. Windows
continues to emit `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`, import `GetStdHandle`/`ReadFile`/
`WriteFile`, expose the native entry point as `smalllang_start`, and link with
`lld-link` without the C runtime.

Linux emits `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, imports libc `read` and `write`, exposes
the native entry point as `main`, and links through WSL. The link path uses the
downloaded Windows LLVM `clang` to produce a Linux ELF object, then invokes WSL
`cc` to produce the final executable. This keeps one Windows-hosted compiler
bootstrap while still validating the final binary inside Linux.

The Linux runtime backend lowers `sys.runtime.print`, `sys.runtime.println`, and
`sys.runtime.readInt` to direct `write`/`read` calls. Standard library `sys.io`
wrappers are still ordinary SmallLang functions and are inlined before the
intrinsic runtime boundary is lowered.

Verification on WSL produced ELF x86-64 executables for `01-function-basic-hello.sl`,
`09-namespace-sys-io.sl`, and `05-function-local.sl`. The `01-function-basic-hello` sample printed
`Hello, dimohy. square = 49`, and the `09-namespace-sys-io` sample accepted stdin
`9` and printed the 9-times table.

## D026 - Shared LLVM Emitter With Target Runtime Platforms

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-08

Windows and Linux output must share the same source-language lowering wherever
the semantics are identical. The compiler now routes target-specific LLVM
runtime details through `LlvmRuntimePlatform` implementations instead of keeping
Windows/Linux branches inside the main emitter.

`ConsoleLlvmEmitter` owns the common lowering:

- function calls and value-flow bindings
- string interpolation
- standard library `sys.io` wrapper inlining
- local-function inlining
- optimized `each` block-function lowering
- runtime integer decimal output
- `readInt` parsing and failure handling

Platform runtime classes own only the target-specific boundary:

- target triple
- native entry point name
- external OS declarations
- stdin/stdout handle setup
- byte-level `smalllang_write`
- byte-level `smalllang_read_stdin`

`WindowsLlvmRuntimePlatform` supplies `GetStdHandle`, `ReadFile`, and
`WriteFile`. `LinuxLlvmRuntimePlatform` supplies libc `read` and `write`.
The linker layer remains target-specific: `WindowsLinker` uses `lld-link`, and
`WslLinuxLinker` uses Windows LLVM `clang` for the ELF object followed by WSL
`cc` for the final Linux executable.

## D027 - Flow-Oriented Conditionals And Bool Expressions

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-08

SmallLang adopts conditionals that match the existing value-flow style instead
of adding a separate parenthesized statement form:

```smalllang
condition -> if {
    thenBody
} else {
    elseBody
}
```

The left-side value must be `Bool`. When `if` is used only for effects, the
`else` branch may be omitted if the then branch returns `Unit`. When `if`
produces a value, both branches must be present and must produce the same type.
Branch-local bindings stay scoped to the branch body.

For ordered multi-branch value selection, SmallLang uses `when`:

```smalllang
when {
    score >= 90 { "A" }
    score >= 80 { "B" }
    score >= 70 { "C" }
    else { "F" }
}
```

`when` evaluates arms in order, requires every arm condition to be `Bool`, and
requires an `else` branch in the current expression form. All branch values must
have the same type.

The current `Bool` expression slice includes `true`, `false`, integer
comparisons (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`), short-circuit `and`/`or`, and
unary `not`. Code generation lowers comparisons to LLVM `icmp`, logical
operators to direct control flow where needed, and `if`/`when` expressions to
branches and phi nodes instead of runtime dispatch.

## D028 - Subject-Value When Shorthand

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-08

When every `when` arm compares the same value, repeating that value in each
condition is unnecessary noise. SmallLang now supports a subject-value form that
keeps the existing flow direction:

```smalllang
score -> when {
    >= 90 { "A" }
    >= 80 { "B" }
    >= 70 { "C" }
    else { "F" }
} -> grade
```

This is the preferred style for ordered threshold checks. The full-condition
form remains valid for cases where each arm has a different condition shape.

The subject expression is evaluated once, then reused by each arm comparison.
The current shorthand supports integer comparisons with `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`,
`>`, and `>=`. Code generation emits one subject value followed by direct LLVM
`icmp`/`br i1` branch checks and the same phi-based value join used by the full
`when` form.

## D029 - Expression Basics And Line Comments

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-08

SmallLang now supports the expression basics needed before broader library and
control-flow work:

- parenthesized expressions
- integer `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
- unary integer `-`
- line comments beginning with `#`

The parser keeps the usual precedence shape: parentheses, unary operators,
multiplicative operators, additive operators, comparison, logical `and`, and
logical `or`. The current arithmetic slice is integer-only. LLVM lowering emits
`add`, `sub`, `mul`, `sdiv`, and `srem` for the new operations.

`examples/06-expression-arithmetic-comments.sl` verifies parentheses, comments, division,
modulo, and `not (...)` grouping.

## D030 - Integer Fold Block Function

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-08

`fold` is the second built-in block function and returns a value:

```smalllang
1..100 -> fold 0 sum, i {
    sum + i
} -> total
```

The first expression after `fold` is the initial accumulator value. The first
name is the accumulator binding inside the block, and the second name is the
range item binding. The block must return the next integer accumulator value.

The backend specializes `fold` directly to LLVM loop basic blocks with phi
values for both the current item and accumulator. It does not allocate a runtime
closure, function pointer, or dynamic block-call dispatch. If the range is empty
because the start is greater than the end, the fold expression returns the
initial accumulator value.

`examples/13-block-fold-sum.sl` verifies `1..100 -> fold 0 sum, i { sum + i }` and prints
`sum = 5050`.

## D031 - Subject When Range Arms

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-08

Subject-value `when` can now use inclusive integer range arms:

```smalllang
score -> when {
    90..100 { "A" }
    80..89 { "B" }
    70..79 { "C" }
    else { "F" }
} -> grade
```

This keeps threshold tables compact when a contiguous range is clearer than a
single-sided comparison. The subject expression is still evaluated once. Each
range arm lowers to two integer comparisons and an `and i1`, followed by the
same `br i1` and phi-based value join used by existing `when`.

`examples/17-condition-when-range.sl` verifies this form.

## D032 - Expected Stdout Example Tests

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-08

Executable samples now have a lightweight expected-output test runner. Expected
fixtures live under `examples/expected` as:

- `{sample}.stdout.txt`
- optional `{sample}.stdin.txt`

The runner is a no-dependency .NET console project at
`tests/SmallLang.ExampleTests`. It compiles each listed sample through
`scripts/smalllang.ps1`, executes the generated Windows binary sequentially, and
compares normalized stdout exactly against the fixture.

Current verified fixtures cover arithmetic/comments, subject `when`, range-arm
`when`, `fold`, `08-block-each-default-it` input/default loop item behavior, and local
functions. The runner is included in `SmallLang.slnx` and is invoked with:

```powershell
dotnet run --project tests\SmallLang.ExampleTests\SmallLang.ExampleTests.csproj --no-build
```

## D033 - Compact Function And When Expression Bodies

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-08

To avoid nested braces for single-expression functions whose body is a `when`,
SmallLang now allows expression-bodied function declarations:

```smalllang
grade: Int -> Text -> when {
    90..100 -> "A"
    80..89 -> "B"
    70..79 -> "C"
    else -> "F"
}
```

This is equivalent to a braced function body with the same final expression.
Local functions remain available only inside braced function bodies because
there is no block in the expression-bodied form.

`when` arms now support single-value shorthand:

```smalllang
condition -> value
else -> fallback
```

Block arms remain valid when the arm needs statements before the final value.

Subject-style `when` arms can also omit an explicit subject inside a one-input
function that uses the default input binding `it`. Explicitly named inputs keep
the subject visible:

```smalllang
grade score: Int -> Text -> score -> when {
    >= 90 -> "A"
    >= 80 -> "B"
    >= 70 -> "C"
    else -> "F"
}
```

The semantic rule is intentionally narrow: subject-style arms without an
explicit `value -> when` require an integer `it` binding in scope. This keeps the
compact form beautiful for default-input functions while making named-input
data flow explicit. Code generation still lowers `when` to direct comparisons,
branches, and phi joins.

`examples/18-condition-when-compact.sl` verifies both compact forms.

## D034 - Purpose-Oriented Sorted Int File Workflow

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-08

SmallLang now supports the first large-data workflow requested by the user:
generate 100,000,000 pseudo-random numbers from `1..1,000,000,000`, store them
sorted in a file, and query the value closest to `500,000,000`.

The implementation deliberately avoids opening a general array/sort feature
first. The generator uses a sorted bucket strategy:

```smalllang
1..100000000 -> each bucket {
    bucket - 1 -> zeroBased
    zeroBased * 10 -> base
    10 -> randomBelow() -> offset
    base + offset + 1 -> value
    value -> writeInt()
}
```

Each 10-wide bucket contributes one pseudo-random value, so output is sorted and
unique as it is written. This is purpose-fit for the workflow but is not a
uniform sample over all possible 100,000,000-element subsets.

New standard-library surface:

- `seedRandom: Int -> Unit`
- `randomBelow: Int -> Int`
- `openIntWriter: Text -> Unit`
- `writeInt: Int -> Unit`
- `closeIntWriter: -> Unit`
- `openIntReader: Text -> Unit`
- `closestInt: Int -> Int`
- `closeIntReader: -> Unit`

The file format is binary little-endian signed 64-bit records. `writeInt` uses a
global 8,192-record buffer before calling the platform write primitive.
`closestInt` assumes the current reader file is sorted ascending and performs a
binary search through fixed-width random access reads.

Runtime lowering remains split by responsibility:

- common LLVM helper: deterministic LCG, buffered writer, path copy helper, and
  sorted-file closest search
- Windows platform layer: `CreateFileA`, `WriteFile`, `ReadFile`,
  `SetFilePointerEx`, `GetFileSizeEx`, and `CloseHandle`
- Linux platform layer: `open`, `write`, `read`, `lseek`, and `close`

The Windows linker no longer uses the previous `/align:16` and `/filealign:16`
settings because mutable data sections made those ultra-small PE settings fail
at process launch. A no-op `__chkstk` symbol is emitted for this CRT-free
runtime slice because generated stack frames remain intentionally small.

Verification:

- `examples/19-stdlib-random-file-demo-generate.sl` produced
  `artifacts/random-sorted-demo.i64` with 1,000 records / 8,000 bytes.
- `examples/20-stdlib-file-demo-query.sl` printed `closest = 4995`; independent
  PowerShell binary-search verification matched.
- `examples/21-stdlib-random-file-100m-generate.sl` produced
  `artifacts/random-sorted-100m.i64` with 100,000,000 records / 800,000,000
  bytes.
- `examples/22-stdlib-file-100m-query.sl` printed `closest = 500000006`;
  independent verification found candidates `499999991` and `500000006`, so
  the closest difference is `6`.
- The demo generator/query pair also compiled and ran on `linux-x64` through WSL,
  with query output `closest = 4995`.
- `dotnet build SmallLang.slnx` passed with 0 warnings and 0 errors.
- `tests/SmallLang.ExampleTests` still passed all 7 existing expected-stdout
  tests.

## D035 - Empty Parentheses On Value-Flow Function Targets

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-08

SmallLang accepted empty call syntax on value-flow function targets:

```smalllang
7 -> square() -> num
"Hello, {name}. square = {num}" -> print()
```

This was only valid immediately after `->`. The parentheses do not carry
arguments; the value on the left remains the argument to the target function.
`7 -> square(7)` is rejected by the parser, and ordinary `square()` outside a
flow target remains a normal zero-argument parenthesized call subject to the
function signature.

The parser records each flow target as a `FlowTarget` with `Path` and
`UsesCallSyntax`. At the time of this decision, semantic analysis and code
generation treated `-> square()` as the same function call as `-> square`, while
a target with `UsesCallSyntax=true` could not become a final flow binding. D036
later changed this so function targets must use `func()`.

`examples/03-flow-call-parens.sl` verifies the accepted syntax. Verification:
`dotnet build SmallLang.slnx` passed, `tests/SmallLang.ExampleTests` passed all
8 expected-stdout samples, `7 -> square(7)` failed in parsing with an empty
parentheses-only diagnostic, and `7 -> value()` failed semantically as an
unknown function instead of becoming a binding.

## D036 - Function Calls Require Parentheses In Flow Syntax

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-08

D035 allowed `-> func()` but still accepted the older `-> func` function-call
target. That left the function/binding distinction visually ambiguous. SmallLang
now requires functions to be visibly called:

```smalllang
getName() -> name
7 -> square() -> num
"Hello, {name}. square = {num}" -> print()
```

The old flow-call spelling is now rejected:

```smalllang
7 -> square -> num
```

Semantic analysis resolves a target path that names a function only when
`UsesCallSyntax=true`; otherwise it reports that the function target must use
`func()`. A final bare single identifier without `()` remains a binding target,
so `value -> name` still introduces a binding. Bare zero-input function names in
expression/source position are no longer treated as implicit calls; use
`getName()`.

All `.sl` examples and standard-library wrappers were updated to use `func()` for
function targets. Verification: all 19 example `.sl` files compiled, the 8
expected-stdout samples passed, `7 -> square -> num` failed with the required
`square()` diagnostic, and `getName -> name` failed as a missing function-call
parentheses case.

## D037 - Block Arguments Omit Empty Function Parentheses

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-08

D036 requires ordinary function targets to use `func()` in value-flow syntax, but
code block arguments are intentionally an exception. When the target is followed
by a brace block, the block itself marks the target as a function-like call:

```smalllang
1..3 -> each {
    it -> println()
}

1..9 -> each i {
    "{i}" -> println()
}
```

The parser handles `source -> path item? { ... }` before ordinary expression
flows, so this form never becomes an ambiguous bare `-> func` call. At this
decision point the semantic slice supported only the built-in block function
`each`; D038 adds `repeat`. Ordinary flow targets such as `7 -> square -> num`
continue to fail and must be written as `7 -> square() -> num`.

## D038 - Repeat Block Function

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-08

To make code-block arguments visible outside range iteration, SmallLang now
supports a second built-in block function:

```smalllang
3 -> repeat turn {
    "repeat turn {turn}" -> println()
}
```

The integer on the left is the count argument, and the brace body is the code
block argument. `repeat` invokes the block with `turn` values `1..count`; when no
item name is given, the default binding is `it`. Counts less than or equal to
zero execute the block zero times. This keeps the D037 rule: block-argument calls
omit `()`, while ordinary value-flow function targets still require `func()`.

## D039 - Grammar-Ordered Example Filenames

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-08

Examples are now named with a two-digit order plus the leading grammar topic so
ordinary filename sorting shows the intended learning/progression order:

```text
01-function-basic-hello.sl
02-function-named-input.sl
03-flow-call-parens.sl
04-main-omitted-top-level.sl
...
22-stdlib-file-100m-query.sl
```

Expected stdout/stdin fixtures under `examples/expected` use the same basename as
their source example. `scripts/smalllang.ps1` defaults to
`examples/01-function-basic-hello.sl`. New cumulative examples should continue
this naming style instead of appending unnumbered names.

## D041 - User-Defined Block Functions

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-08

Block functions are no longer limited to built-ins. A user-defined block function
declares a normal input, a `Unit` return, and a block input:

```smalllang
runTimes count: Int -> Unit block turn: Int {
    1..count -> each turn {
        turn -> yield()
    }
}

main {
    3 -> runTimes step {
        "custom block step {step}" -> println()
    }
}
```

The declaration body is inlined at the call site. Inside the declaration,
`value -> yield()` invokes the executable block passed by the caller, binding the
yielded value to the caller's block item name. `yield()` is valid only inside a
user-defined block function and must be the final value-flow target.

## D040 - VS Code Language Support Extension

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-08

SmallLang now includes a local declarative VS Code language support extension
under `tools/vscode-smalllang`. It registers `.sl` as `smalllang`, contributes a
TextMate grammar for comments, strings, interpolation, function declarations,
flow calls, block-function calls, keywords, types, constants, numbers, and
operators, and provides snippets for `main`, functions, flow calls, `each`,
`repeat`, and `when`.

Install locally with:

```powershell
Push-Location tools\vscode-smalllang
npx --yes @vscode/vsce package --no-dependencies --allow-missing-repository
code --install-extension .\smalllang-language-support-0.1.2.vsix
Pop-Location
```

## D042 - Browser WebAssembly Target

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-09

SmallLang now supports a browser WebAssembly target in addition to the native
Windows and Linux targets:

```powershell
.\scripts\smalllang.ps1 -Source examples\23-webassembly-browser.sl -Output artifacts\23-webassembly-browser.wasm -Target wasm32-browser -KeepTemps
python -m http.server 5080
```

The compiler emits LLVM IR with the `wasm32-unknown-unknown-wasm` target triple,
uses the existing common LLVM lowering for functions, flow bindings,
interpolation, conditionals, `fold`, and output calls, compiles the IR with
Windows LLVM `clang`, and links the final `.wasm` with `wasm-ld`.

The generated module exports `smalllang_start` and `memory`. It imports a single
browser-hosted output boundary:

```text
env.smalllang_browser_write(ptr, len) -> i32
```

The static runner under `examples/browser` implements this import by reading
UTF-8 bytes from exported linear memory and appending them to the page output.
The current browser target intentionally supports stdout-style text output
first. `readInt` and sorted-int file runtime primitives are present as explicit
failure stubs for this target rather than silently mapping to browser prompts or
storage.

`examples/23-webassembly-browser.sl` is cumulative and also runs as a native
example. Its expected output fixture verifies:

```text
Hello from SmallLang WebAssembly
8 squared = 64
1..5 sum = 15
```
