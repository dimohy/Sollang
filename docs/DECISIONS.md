# SmallLang Decision Log

This file records accepted or working decisions so the language design can
evolve without losing context.

## D001 - Specification Before Implementation

Status: accepted
Date: 2026-07-07

SmallLang remains in specification mode until the user explicitly asks for
implementation. No compiler, parser, LLVM backend, runtime, or build
infrastructure should be created before that.

## D002 - Compiler Implementation Stack

Status: accepted
Date: 2026-07-07

When implementation begins, the compiler should use the latest .NET and latest
C# Preview features unless a later constraint requires otherwise. Actual SDK,
C# language, and LLVM versions must be verified against official sources before
implementation starts.

## D003 - Native LLVM Output

Status: accepted
Date: 2026-07-07

SmallLang compiles through LLVM and ultimately produces highly optimized native
executables. The language and compiler pipeline should be designed around
efficient LLVM lowering rather than treating LLVM as an afterthought.

## D004 - First Program Syntax

Status: working decision
Date: 2026-07-07

The first complete SmallLang program is:

```smalllang
main {
    name = "dimohy"
    print("Hello, $name")
}
```

The `main` block is explicit, short, and parser-friendly. `name = value` is the
initial local binding form. Full function syntax is not decided yet.

## D005 - `print` As Platform-Bound Primitive

Status: working decision
Date: 2026-07-07

`print` appears as a simple prelude call in source code, but resolves internally
to `core.io.print` and lowers to a platform-specific stdout backend selected by
the target triple.

The design must preserve:

- simple source syntax
- cross-platform correctness
- Unicode-correct Windows console behavior
- efficient static string output
- no silent fallback for unsupported targets
- explicit handling of output failure

## D006 - Bindings Without Declaration Keywords

Status: working decision
Date: 2026-07-07

Local variables are introduced with the smallest readable form:

```smalllang
name = "dimohy"
```

There is no `let`, `var`, or declaration keyword in the initial syntax. For now,
the first `name = expression` in a block introduces a binding, and reusing the
same name in the same scope is a compile-time error. Reassignment and mutability
remain open design questions.

## D007 - Minimal String Interpolation

Status: superseded by D046
Date: 2026-07-07

Double-quoted strings originally supported simple binding/path interpolation:

```smalllang
"Hello, $name"
```

The initial interpolation form accepts names and reserved path syntax only, not
arbitrary expressions. This keeps tokenization, parsing, semantic analysis, and
LLVM lowering simple while still making the first useful program expressive.

D046 keeps the `$name` shorthand but adds `$(expr)` and removes brace-based
interpolation.

## D008 - Local LLVM Bootstrap

Status: accepted
Date: 2026-07-07

LLVM binaries must not be committed to the repository. The build script
downloads LLVM 22.1.8 into `.tools` when missing and uses that local toolchain
for native code generation. `.tools`, `artifacts`, and build outputs are ignored
by Git.

## D009 - First Native Backend

Status: working decision
Date: 2026-07-07

The first native backend targets Windows x64 and links with `lld-link` without
the C runtime. The generated executable imports only `GetStdHandle` and
`WriteFile` from `kernel32.dll` for the first `print` program. The verified
first executable size is 752 bytes.

## D010 - Modular Compiler Source Layout

Status: accepted
Date: 2026-07-07

Even small requests should keep the compiler modular. The compiler source is
split by responsibility into CLI, Lexing, Parsing, Syntax, Semantics, CodeGen,
and Tooling modules. `Program.cs` must stay as a minimal entry point, not a
container for lexer/parser/codegen/linker implementation.

## D011 - Lexer Source Generation From SmallLang Rules

Status: accepted
Date: 2026-07-07

SmallLang lexer rules are expressed in `syntax/smalllang.lexer`. A Roslyn incremental
source generator in `src/SmallLang.Compiler.Generators` reads that rules file and
generates `TokenKind` and `Lexer` during compiler build. This keeps the language
surface concise and regular while producing deterministic C# tokenization code.

## D012 - Parser Source Generation From SmallLang Grammar

Status: accepted
Date: 2026-07-07

SmallLang parser rules are expressed in `syntax/smalllang.grammar`. A Roslyn incremental
source generator reads that grammar file as an MSBuild `AdditionalFiles` input
and emits the current token-to-AST parser during compiler build.

ANTLR, parser combinators, and C# embedded parser generators remain valid future
options, but they are not the best fit for the first SmallLang slice. ANTLR adds a
separate grammar toolchain and C# runtime dependency. Parser combinators and
attribute-based C# parser generators keep grammar inside C# code instead of a
small language-owned syntax file. The current source-generator approach keeps
the repo small, dependency-light, modular, and aligned with the existing lexer
generation model.

The first parser generator intentionally supports only the approved initial
grammar shape. Broader grammar features should be added when the language
surface actually needs them.

## D013 - Value-Flow Calls As Preferred Call Style

Status: implemented, superseded in parser shape by D016
Date: 2026-07-07

SmallLang adopts `value -> function()` as the preferred call style when a primary
input value flows into a function:

```smalllang
"Hello, $name" -> print()
```

This form makes data flow visually explicit. The expression on the left is the
first input to the callable path on the right. For the initial unary case, it is
semantically equivalent to:

```smalllang
print("Hello, $name")
```

Parenthesized calls remain valid as a conventional compatibility syntax and for
cases where the value-flow form is not expressive enough. The preferred SmallLang
style is value-flow first:

```smalllang
result = value -> transform
```

Function type notation should use the same left-to-right direction:

```smalllang
print: Text -> Io<Unit>
```

The first implementation lowered unary value-flow calls to the same call AST
shape used by the existing parenthesized call. D016 keeps value-flow as its own
AST node so a final target can bind the result.

## D014 - Initial Integer Addition And Scalar Interpolation

Status: accepted
Date: 2026-07-07

SmallLang supports decimal integer literals and left-associative integer `+` in the
current compiler slice:

```smalllang
sum = 20 + 22
```

The first numeric model is intentionally narrow. Integer literals evaluate to
signed 64-bit values in the semantic evaluator, and `+` performs checked integer
addition. Mixed string/integer `+`, floating point values, arbitrary precision
numbers, suffixes, and final overflow policy syntax are not decided yet.

String interpolation can display integer bindings:

```smalllang
"Number: $sum" -> print()
```

This first numeric step initially allowed the compiler to fold the whole sample
to output bytes. D015 changes the current sample to exercise runtime function
calls and runtime integer-to-decimal output instead.

## D015 - Runtime Function Sample

Status: implemented, superseded as the current sample by D016
Date: 2026-07-07

The D015 sample should not be represented only as one compile-time output
buffer. It used zero-argument functions so the generated LLVM contained real
runtime calls:

```smalllang
getName: -> Text {
    "dimohy"
}

getNum: -> Int {
    20 + 22
}

main {
    name = getName()
    num = getNum()
    "Hello, $name. getNum() = $num" -> print()
}
```

The D015 implementation parsed `getName: -> Text { ... }` and
`getNum: -> Int { ... }` as zero-argument expression functions. Semantic
analysis type-checks the function bodies and main bindings. The Windows LLVM
backend emits `@smalllang_fn_getName`, `@smalllang_fn_getNum`, runtime `i64` addition,
segmented `WriteFile` output, and a runtime integer decimal conversion helper
instead of one full static output string. D016 is the current sample and
supersedes the `getNum` naming.

## D016 - Flow Binding And One-Input Square Function

Status: implemented, superseded by D036
Date: 2026-07-07

SmallLang adopts statement-level value-flow binding for the current sample:

```smalllang
getName: -> Text {
    "dimohy"
}

square: Int -> Int {
    it * it
}

main {
    getName() -> name
    7 -> square() -> num
    "Hello, $name. square = $num" -> print()
}
```

`getName() -> name` calls the zero-input function and binds its result to `name`.
`7 -> square() -> num` passes `7` into a one-input function, where the implicit
input binding is named `it`, then binds the returned value to `num`.

The parser now preserves value-flow as `FlowExpression` rather than immediately
lowering it to `CallExpression`. Semantic analysis resolves each target as a
known one-input function, `print`, or a final statement-level binding target.
Unknown intermediate targets are compile-time errors, and flow expression
statements must either end in `print` or bind their result.

The current implementation adds the `*` token/operator, parses
`square: Int -> Int { it * it }`, emits `@smalllang_fn_square(i64 %it)`, lowers the
body to `mul nsw i64 %it, %it`, and calls it as `@smalllang_fn_square(i64 7)`.
The verified output at D016 time was `Hello, dimohy. square = 49`; the Windows
x64 executable size at D016 time remained 1,088 bytes.

## D017 - Input Primitive And Inclusive Range Loop

Status: implemented, loop spelling superseded by D019
Date: 2026-07-08

SmallLang samples are cumulative. New samples should be added alongside earlier
samples instead of replacing `examples/01-function-basic-hello.sl`.

The next implemented sample reads an integer and prints that multiplication
table:

```smalllang
main {
    "n = ? " -> readInt() -> n

    each i in 1..9 {
        n * i -> value
        "$n x $i = $value" -> println()
    }
}
```

`readInt` mirrors output value-flow style: a `Text` prompt flows into the input
primitive and the resulting `Int` can flow into a binding target. The
parenthesized form `readInt("n = ? ")` remains valid. Internally, `readInt`
resolves to a selected backend primitive, currently the Windows stdin path using
`ReadFile`; this keeps the source syntax independent from the platform backend
and leaves room for POSIX/WASI input lowering later.

`println` is accepted as the first newline-output convenience. It shares the
same output backend as `print`, then emits one line-feed byte in the current
runtime slice.

The first loop syntax is:

```smalllang
each i in 1..9 {
    ...
}
```

This is an inclusive integer range loop. The loop variable is scoped to the loop
body, and bindings created inside the body do not escape the body. The current
implementation lowers the loop to LLVM basic blocks with an SSA phi value for
the loop variable. Descending ranges are not specified yet; a range whose start
is greater than its end executes zero times.

After adding the input and loop runtime, the verified executable sizes are 1,104
bytes for `examples/01-function-basic-hello.sl` and 1,584 bytes for
`examples/07-block-each-explicit-item.sl`.

## D018 - Arrow Binding As Preferred Assignment Direction

Status: accepted
Date: 2026-07-08

SmallLang should prefer arrow-oriented binding even for local assignment-like
introductions. New samples should use:

```smalllang
expression -> name
n * i -> value
```

instead of leading with:

```smalllang
name = expression
value = n * i
```

This keeps local binding aligned with the language's value-flow direction:
values are written first, then flow into their binding target. The existing
`name = expression` form remains accepted as a compatibility syntax for now, but
it is no longer the preferred style for examples or documentation. This decision
supersedes D004/D006 as the current surface-language direction while preserving
those entries as historical context.

## D019 - Arrow Range Loop With Optional Item Name

Status: superseded by D036
Date: 2026-07-08

SmallLang's preferred range loop syntax is now flow-oriented:

```smalllang
1..9 -> each i {
    n * i -> value
    "$n x $i = $value" -> println()
}
```

The range expression flows into `each`, and the optional identifier after `each`
names the current item. When the identifier is omitted, the loop item is bound as
`it`:

```smalllang
1..9 -> each {
    n * it -> value
    "$n x $it = $value" -> println()
}
```

This gives the language two final current forms:

- `start..end -> each { ... }` for the default item binding `it`
- `start..end -> each item { ... }` for an explicit item binding

The older `each item in start..end { ... }` spelling remains accepted as a
compatibility form, but new samples and documentation should prefer the
flow-oriented loop syntax.

## D020 - Optional Function Input Names

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-08

SmallLang one-input functions now follow the same naming shape as `each`.

When the input name is omitted, the function body receives the value as `it`:

```smalllang
square: Int -> Int {
    it * it
}
```

When the input name is supplied after the function name, the body receives the
value through that binding:

```smalllang
square n: Int -> Int {
    n * n
}
```

This mirrors the loop forms:

```smalllang
1..9 -> each {
    it
}

1..9 -> each i {
    i
}
```

The older `square: Int -> Int { it * it }` form remains valid and is the default
input-binding form. The explicit form `square n: Int -> Int { n * n }` is
available when naming the input improves readability.

## D021 - Built-In Block Functions And Optimized `each`

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-08

`each` should be understood as the first built-in block function rather than as
only a hard-coded loop statement:

```smalllang
1..9 -> each i {
    n * i -> value
    "$n x $i = $value" -> println()
}
```

Semantically, the range value flows into the block function `each`, `i` names the
block invocation input, and the brace body is the executable block argument.
The default item form follows the same rule:

```smalllang
1..9 -> each {
    n * it -> value
    "$n x $it = $value" -> println()
}
```

The compiler now represents this preferred form as a generic block-function call
AST. The current semantic layer only accepts `each` as a block-function target;
future built-ins or user-defined block functions can build on the same model.

This language model must not force inefficient runtime lowering. The Windows
LLVM backend specializes the built-in `each` block function directly into loop
basic blocks with an SSA phi value for the item binding. It does not allocate a
closure, emit a function pointer, or perform dynamic block dispatch for the
current built-in loop.

The older `each item in start..end { ... }` spelling remains accepted as a
compatibility syntax and is converted into the same internal block-function call
shape before semantic analysis.

## D022 - `sys.io` Is A SmallLang Standard Library Module

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-08

`print`, `println`, and `readInt` should not be compiler-owned special functions
under the `sys.io` name. They are ordinary functions provided by the standard
library and imported globally through aliases:

```text
print   -> sys.io.print
println -> sys.io.println
readInt -> sys.io.readInt
```

The actual `sys.io` module is implemented in SmallLang:

```smalllang
namespace sys.io

import sys.runtime as rt

print value: Text -> Unit {
    value -> rt.print()
}

println value: Text -> Unit {
    value -> rt.println()
}

readInt prompt: Text -> Int {
    prompt -> rt.readInt()
}
```

The lower runtime boundary is declared separately in the standard library with
`= intrinsic`:

```smalllang
namespace sys.runtime

print value: Text -> Unit = intrinsic
println value: Text -> Unit = intrinsic
readInt prompt: Text -> Int = intrinsic
```

This required two syntax additions for the current implementation slice:

- path-qualified function declarations, such as
  `sys.io.print value: Text -> Unit { ... }`
- intrinsic declarations, such as
  `sys.runtime.print value: Text -> Unit = intrinsic`
- namespace declarations and import aliases, such as `namespace sys.io` and
  `import sys.runtime as rt`

The compiler loads `stdlib/sys/runtime.sl` and `stdlib/sys/io.sl` before user
source, then adds only alias entries for `print`, `println`, and `readInt`.
The semantic model resolves `sys.io` through the same function table as user
functions. The Windows LLVM backend inlines standard library wrappers and lowers
only the `sys.runtime` intrinsic boundary to direct `ReadFile`/`WriteFile`
runtime code, so verified IR does not emit `sys.io` function calls.

## D023 - Local Functions Inside Functions

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-08

Function declarations may appear at the start of another function body:

```smalllang
scale n: Int -> Int {
    double value: Int -> Int {
        value * 2
    }

    addBase value: Int -> Int {
        value + n
    }

    n -> double -> addBase
}
```

Local functions use the same function input naming rules as top-level functions.
Their names are scoped to the containing function and functions nested below it;
they are not added to the global function table and cannot be called from
`main` or unrelated functions.

Local functions can read bindings from the containing function. In the sample
above, `addBase` reads the outer input binding `n`. The current Windows LLVM
backend lowers local functions by inlining their bodies at the call site, so no
global LLVM symbol is emitted for `double` or `addBase`. Recursive local
functions are not part of the current runtime slice.

## D024 - Namespace And Import Aliases For Standard Library Modules

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-08

Standard library files should not repeat their full namespace and dependency
paths on every function declaration and runtime call. SmallLang now accepts an
optional file-level namespace declaration followed by import declarations:

```smalllang
namespace sys.io

import sys.runtime as rt
```

Within a namespaced file, top-level single-segment function declarations are
qualified by that namespace:

```smalllang
print value: Text -> Unit {
    value -> rt.print()
}
```

This defines `sys.io.print`. The import alias rewrites `rt.print` to
`sys.runtime.print` before semantic analysis, so the semantic model and LLVM
lowering still work with fully qualified canonical names.

The lower runtime boundary uses the same namespace rule:

```smalllang
namespace sys.runtime

print value: Text -> Unit = intrinsic
println value: Text -> Unit = intrinsic
readInt prompt: Text -> Int = intrinsic
```

Local function declarations are not namespace-qualified. They keep the D023
scope rule and remain visible only inside the containing function.

## D025 - Linux x64 Target Through WSL

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-08

SmallLang now supports a `linux-x64` compiler target in addition to the default
`windows-x64` target:

```powershell
.\scripts\smalllang.ps1 -Source examples\01-function-basic-hello.sl -Output artifacts\01-function-basic-hello-linux -Target linux-x64 -KeepTemps
```

The compiler selects the LLVM target triple from the requested target. Windows
continues to emit `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`, import `GetStdHandle`/`ReadFile`/
`WriteFile`, expose the native entry point as `smalllang_start`, and link with
`lld-link` without the C runtime.

Linux emits `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, imports libc `read` and `write`, exposes
the native entry point as `main`, and links through WSL. The link path uses the
downloaded Windows LLVM `clang` to produce a Linux ELF object, then invokes WSL
`cc` to produce the final executable. This keeps one Windows-hosted compiler
bootstrap while still validating the final binary inside Linux.

The Linux runtime backend lowers `sys.runtime.print`, `sys.runtime.println`, and
`sys.runtime.readInt` to direct `write`/`read` calls. Standard library `sys.io`
wrappers are still ordinary SmallLang functions and are inlined before the
intrinsic runtime boundary is lowered.

Verification on WSL produced ELF x86-64 executables for `01-function-basic-hello.sl`,
`09-namespace-sys-io.sl`, and `05-function-local.sl`. The `01-function-basic-hello` sample printed
`Hello, dimohy. square = 49`, and the `09-namespace-sys-io` sample accepted stdin
`9` and printed the 9-times table.

## D026 - Shared LLVM Emitter With Target Runtime Platforms

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-08

Windows and Linux output must share the same source-language lowering wherever
the semantics are identical. The compiler now routes target-specific LLVM
runtime details through `LlvmRuntimePlatform` implementations instead of keeping
Windows/Linux branches inside the main emitter.

`LlvmEmitter` owns the common lowering:

- function calls and value-flow bindings
- string interpolation
- standard library `sys.io` wrapper inlining
- local-function inlining
- optimized `each` block-function lowering
- runtime integer decimal output
- `readInt` parsing and failure handling

Platform runtime classes own only the target-specific boundary:

- target triple
- native entry point name
- external OS declarations
- stdin/stdout handle setup
- byte-level `smalllang_write`
- byte-level `smalllang_read_stdin`

`WindowsLlvmRuntimePlatform` supplies `GetStdHandle`, `ReadFile`, and
`WriteFile`. `LinuxLlvmRuntimePlatform` supplies libc `read` and `write`.
The linker layer remains target-specific: `WindowsLinker` uses `lld-link`, and
`WslLinuxLinker` uses Windows LLVM `clang` for the ELF object followed by WSL
`cc` for the final Linux executable.

## D027 - Flow-Oriented Conditionals And Bool Expressions

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-08

SmallLang adopts conditionals that match the existing value-flow style instead
of adding a separate parenthesized statement form:

```smalllang
condition -> if {
    thenBody
} else {
    elseBody
}
```

The left-side value must be `Bool`. When `if` is used only for effects, the
`else` branch may be omitted if the then branch returns `Unit`. When `if`
produces a value, both branches must be present and must produce the same type.
Branch-local bindings stay scoped to the branch body.

For ordered multi-branch value selection, SmallLang uses `when`:

```smalllang
when {
    score >= 90 { "A" }
    score >= 80 { "B" }
    score >= 70 { "C" }
    else { "F" }
}
```

`when` evaluates arms in order, requires every arm condition to be `Bool`, and
requires an `else` branch in the current expression form. All branch values must
have the same type.

The current `Bool` expression slice includes `true`, `false`, integer
comparisons (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`), short-circuit `and`/`or`, and
unary `not`. Code generation lowers comparisons to LLVM `icmp`, logical
operators to direct control flow where needed, and `if`/`when` expressions to
branches and phi nodes instead of runtime dispatch.

## D028 - Subject-Value When Shorthand

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-08

When every `when` arm compares the same value, repeating that value in each
condition is unnecessary noise. SmallLang now supports a subject-value form that
keeps the existing flow direction:

```smalllang
score -> when {
    >= 90 { "A" }
    >= 80 { "B" }
    >= 70 { "C" }
    else { "F" }
} -> grade
```

This is the preferred style for ordered threshold checks. The full-condition
form remains valid for cases where each arm has a different condition shape.

The subject expression is evaluated once, then reused by each arm comparison.
The current shorthand supports integer comparisons with `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`,
`>`, and `>=`. Code generation emits one subject value followed by direct LLVM
`icmp`/`br i1` branch checks and the same phi-based value join used by the full
`when` form.

## D029 - Expression Basics And Line Comments

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-08

SmallLang now supports the expression basics needed before broader library and
control-flow work:

- parenthesized expressions
- integer `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
- unary integer `-`
- line comments beginning with `#`

The parser keeps the usual precedence shape: parentheses, unary operators,
multiplicative operators, additive operators, comparison, logical `and`, and
logical `or`. The current arithmetic slice is integer-only. LLVM lowering emits
`add`, `sub`, `mul`, `sdiv`, and `srem` for the new operations.

`examples/06-expression-arithmetic-comments.sl` verifies parentheses, comments, division,
modulo, and `not (...)` grouping.

## D030 - Integer Fold Block Function

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-08

`fold` is the second built-in block function and returns a value:

```smalllang
1..100 -> fold 0 sum, i {
    sum + i
} -> total
```

The first expression after `fold` is the initial accumulator value. The first
name is the accumulator binding inside the block, and the second name is the
range item binding. The block must return the next integer accumulator value.

The backend specializes `fold` directly to LLVM loop basic blocks with phi
values for both the current item and accumulator. It does not allocate a runtime
closure, function pointer, or dynamic block-call dispatch. If the range is empty
because the start is greater than the end, the fold expression returns the
initial accumulator value.

`examples/13-block-fold-sum.sl` verifies `1..100 -> fold 0 sum, i { sum + i }` and prints
`sum = 5050`.

## D031 - Subject When Range Arms

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-08

Subject-value `when` can now use inclusive integer range arms:

```smalllang
score -> when {
    90..100 { "A" }
    80..89 { "B" }
    70..79 { "C" }
    else { "F" }
} -> grade
```

This keeps threshold tables compact when a contiguous range is clearer than a
single-sided comparison. The subject expression is still evaluated once. Each
range arm lowers to two integer comparisons and an `and i1`, followed by the
same `br i1` and phi-based value join used by existing `when`.

`examples/17-condition-when-range.sl` verifies this form.

## D032 - Expected Stdout Example Tests

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-08

Executable samples now have a lightweight expected-output test runner. Expected
fixtures live under `examples/expected` as:

- `{sample}.stdout.txt`
- optional `{sample}.stdin.txt`

The runner is a no-dependency .NET console project at
`tests/SmallLang.ExampleTests`. It compiles each listed sample through
`scripts/smalllang.ps1`, executes the generated Windows binary sequentially, and
compares normalized stdout exactly against the fixture.

Current verified fixtures cover arithmetic/comments, subject `when`, range-arm
`when`, `fold`, `08-block-each-default-it` input/default loop item behavior, and local
functions. The runner is included in `SmallLang.slnx` and is invoked with:

```powershell
dotnet run --project tests\SmallLang.ExampleTests\SmallLang.ExampleTests.csproj --no-build
```

## D033 - Compact Function And When Expression Bodies

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-08

To avoid nested braces for single-expression functions whose body is a `when`,
SmallLang now allows expression-bodied function declarations:

```smalllang
grade: Int -> Text -> when {
    90..100 -> "A"
    80..89 -> "B"
    70..79 -> "C"
    else -> "F"
}
```

This is equivalent to a braced function body with the same final expression.
Local functions remain available only inside braced function bodies because
there is no block in the expression-bodied form.

`when` arms now support single-value shorthand:

```smalllang
condition -> value
else -> fallback
```

Block arms remain valid when the arm needs statements before the final value.

Subject-style `when` arms can also omit an explicit subject inside a one-input
function that uses the default input binding `it`. Explicitly named inputs keep
the subject visible:

```smalllang
grade score: Int -> Text -> score -> when {
    >= 90 -> "A"
    >= 80 -> "B"
    >= 70 -> "C"
    else -> "F"
}
```

The semantic rule is intentionally narrow: subject-style arms without an
explicit `value -> when` require an integer `it` binding in scope. This keeps the
compact form beautiful for default-input functions while making named-input
data flow explicit. Code generation still lowers `when` to direct comparisons,
branches, and phi joins.

`examples/18-condition-when-compact.sl` verifies both compact forms.

## D034 - Purpose-Oriented Sorted Int File Workflow

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-08

SmallLang now supports the first large-data workflow requested by the user:
generate 100,000,000 pseudo-random numbers from `1..1,000,000,000`, store them
sorted in a file, and query the value closest to `500,000,000`.

The implementation deliberately avoids opening a general array/sort feature
first. The generator uses a sorted bucket strategy:

```smalllang
1..100000000 -> each bucket {
    bucket - 1 -> zeroBased
    zeroBased * 10 -> base
    10 -> randomBelow() -> offset
    base + offset + 1 -> value
    value -> writeInt()
}
```

Each 10-wide bucket contributes one pseudo-random value, so output is sorted and
unique as it is written. This is purpose-fit for the workflow but is not a
uniform sample over all possible 100,000,000-element subsets.

New standard-library surface:

- `seedRandom: Int -> Unit`
- `randomBelow: Int -> Int`
- `openIntWriter: Text -> Unit`
- `writeInt: Int -> Unit`
- `closeIntWriter: -> Unit`
- `openIntReader: Text -> Unit`
- `closestInt: Int -> Int`
- `closeIntReader: -> Unit`

The file format is binary little-endian signed 64-bit records. `writeInt` uses a
global 8,192-record buffer before calling the platform write primitive.
`closestInt` assumes the current reader file is sorted ascending and performs a
binary search through fixed-width random access reads.

Runtime lowering remains split by responsibility:

- common LLVM helper: deterministic LCG, buffered writer, path copy helper, and
  sorted-file closest search
- Windows platform layer: `CreateFileA`, `WriteFile`, `ReadFile`,
  `SetFilePointerEx`, `GetFileSizeEx`, and `CloseHandle`
- Linux platform layer: `open`, `write`, `read`, `lseek`, and `close`

The Windows linker no longer uses the previous `/align:16` and `/filealign:16`
settings because mutable data sections made those ultra-small PE settings fail
at process launch. A no-op `__chkstk` symbol is emitted for this CRT-free
runtime slice because generated stack frames remain intentionally small.

Verification:

- `examples/19-stdlib-random-file-demo-generate.sl` produced
  `artifacts/random-sorted-demo.i64` with 1,000 records / 8,000 bytes.
- `examples/20-stdlib-file-demo-query.sl` printed `closest = 4995`; independent
  PowerShell binary-search verification matched.
- `examples/21-stdlib-random-file-100m-generate.sl` produced
  `artifacts/random-sorted-100m.i64` with 100,000,000 records / 800,000,000
  bytes.
- `examples/22-stdlib-file-100m-query.sl` printed `closest = 500000006`;
  independent verification found candidates `499999991` and `500000006`, so
  the closest difference is `6`.
- The demo generator/query pair also compiled and ran on `linux-x64` through WSL,
  with query output `closest = 4995`.
- `dotnet build SmallLang.slnx` passed with 0 warnings and 0 errors.
- `tests/SmallLang.ExampleTests` still passed all 7 existing expected-stdout
  tests.

## D035 - Empty Parentheses On Value-Flow Function Targets

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-08

SmallLang accepted empty call syntax on value-flow function targets:

```smalllang
7 -> square() -> num
"Hello, $name. square = $num" -> print()
```

This was only valid immediately after `->`. The parentheses do not carry
arguments; the value on the left remains the argument to the target function.
`7 -> square(7)` is rejected by the parser, and ordinary `square()` outside a
flow target remains a normal zero-argument parenthesized call subject to the
function signature.

The parser records each flow target as a `FlowTarget` with `Path` and
`UsesCallSyntax`. At the time of this decision, semantic analysis and code
generation treated `-> square()` as the same function call as `-> square`, while
a target with `UsesCallSyntax=true` could not become a final flow binding. D036
later changed this so function targets must use `func()`.

`examples/03-flow-call-parens.sl` verifies the accepted syntax. Verification:
`dotnet build SmallLang.slnx` passed, `tests/SmallLang.ExampleTests` passed all
8 expected-stdout samples, `7 -> square(7)` failed in parsing with an empty
parentheses-only diagnostic, and `7 -> value()` failed semantically as an
unknown function instead of becoming a binding.

## D036 - Function Calls Require Parentheses In Flow Syntax

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-08

D035 allowed `-> func()` but still accepted the older `-> func` function-call
target. That left the function/binding distinction visually ambiguous. SmallLang
now requires functions to be visibly called:

```smalllang
getName() -> name
7 -> square() -> num
"Hello, $name. square = $num" -> print()
```

The old flow-call spelling is now rejected:

```smalllang
7 -> square -> num
```

Semantic analysis resolves a target path that names a function only when
`UsesCallSyntax=true`; otherwise it reports that the function target must use
`func()`. A final bare single identifier without `()` remains a binding target,
so `value -> name` still introduces a binding. Bare zero-input function names in
expression/source position are no longer treated as implicit calls; use
`getName()`.

All `.sl` examples and standard-library wrappers were updated to use `func()` for
function targets. Verification: all 19 example `.sl` files compiled, the 8
expected-stdout samples passed, `7 -> square -> num` failed with the required
`square()` diagnostic, and `getName -> name` failed as a missing function-call
parentheses case.

## D037 - Block Arguments Omit Empty Function Parentheses

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-08

D036 requires ordinary function targets to use `func()` in value-flow syntax, but
code block arguments are intentionally an exception. When the target is followed
by a brace block, the block itself marks the target as a function-like call:

```smalllang
1..3 -> each {
    it -> println()
}

1..9 -> each i {
    "$i" -> println()
}
```

The parser handles `source -> path item? { ... }` before ordinary expression
flows, so this form never becomes an ambiguous bare `-> func` call. At this
decision point the semantic slice supported only the built-in block function
`each`; D038 adds `repeat`. Ordinary flow targets such as `7 -> square -> num`
continue to fail and must be written as `7 -> square() -> num`.

## D038 - Repeat Block Function

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-08

To make code-block arguments visible outside range iteration, SmallLang now
supports a second built-in block function:

```smalllang
3 -> repeat turn {
    "repeat turn $turn" -> println()
}
```

The integer on the left is the count argument, and the brace body is the code
block argument. `repeat` invokes the block with `turn` values `1..count`; when no
item name is given, the default binding is `it`. Counts less than or equal to
zero execute the block zero times. This keeps the D037 rule: block-argument calls
omit `()`, while ordinary value-flow function targets still require `func()`.

## D039 - Grammar-Ordered Example Filenames

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-08

Examples are now named with a two-digit order plus the leading grammar topic so
ordinary filename sorting shows the intended learning/progression order:

```text
01-function-basic-hello.sl
02-function-named-input.sl
03-flow-call-parens.sl
04-main-omitted-top-level.sl
...
22-stdlib-file-100m-query.sl
```

Expected stdout/stdin fixtures under `examples/expected` use the same basename as
their source example. `scripts/smalllang.ps1` defaults to
`examples/01-function-basic-hello.sl`. New cumulative examples should continue
this naming style instead of appending unnumbered names.

## D041 - User-Defined Block Functions

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-08

Block functions are no longer limited to built-ins. A user-defined block function
declares a normal input, a `Unit` return, and a block input:

```smalllang
runTimes count: Int -> Unit block turn: Int {
    1..count -> each turn {
        turn -> yield()
    }
}

main {
    3 -> runTimes step {
        "custom block step $step" -> println()
    }
}
```

The declaration body is inlined at the call site. Inside the declaration,
`value -> yield()` invokes the executable block passed by the caller, binding the
yielded value to the caller's block item name. `yield()` is valid only inside a
user-defined block function and must be the final value-flow target.

## D040 - VS Code Language Support Extension

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-08

SmallLang now includes a local declarative VS Code language support extension
under `tools/vscode-smalllang`. It registers `.sl` as `smalllang`, contributes a
TextMate grammar for comments, strings, interpolation, function declarations,
flow calls, block-function calls, keywords, types, constants, numbers, and
operators, and provides snippets for `main`, functions, flow calls, `each`,
`repeat`, and `when`.

Install locally with:

```powershell
Push-Location tools\vscode-smalllang
npx --yes @vscode/vsce package --no-dependencies --allow-missing-repository
code --install-extension .\smalllang-language-support-0.1.2.vsix
Pop-Location
```

## D042 - Browser WebAssembly Target

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-09

SmallLang now supports a browser WebAssembly target in addition to the native
Windows and Linux targets:

```powershell
.\scripts\smalllang.ps1 -Source examples\23-webassembly-browser.sl -Output artifacts\23-webassembly-browser.wasm -Target wasm32-browser -KeepTemps
python -m http.server 5080
```

The compiler emits LLVM IR with the `wasm32-unknown-unknown-wasm` target triple,
uses the existing common LLVM lowering for functions, flow bindings,
interpolation, conditionals, `fold`, and output calls, compiles the IR with
Windows LLVM `clang`, and links the final `.wasm` with `wasm-ld`.

The generated module exports `smalllang_start` and `memory`. It imports a single
browser-hosted output boundary:

```text
env.smalllang_browser_write(ptr, len) -> i32
```

The static runner under `examples/browser` implements this import by reading
UTF-8 bytes from exported linear memory and appending them to the page output.
The current browser target intentionally supports stdout-style text output
first. `readInt` and sorted-int file runtime primitives are present as explicit
failure stubs for this target rather than silently mapping to browser prompts or
storage.

`examples/23-webassembly-browser.sl` is cumulative and also runs as a native
example. Its expected output fixture verifies:

```text
Hello from SmallLang WebAssembly
8 squared = 64
1..5 sum = 15
```

## D043 - Arrays Without A Garbage Collector

Status: working decision
Date: 2026-07-09

SmallLang's static and dynamic array design should follow Rust's ownership
model rather than a garbage-collected reference model. The core split is:

```text
[T; N]      owned fixed-size array
[T; ~]      owned growable heap array
&[T]        shared borrowed slice view
&mut [T]    exclusive mutable borrowed slice view
```

Static arrays own a fixed number of initialized elements, with the length known
at compile time. They use Rust-like type syntax such as `[Int; 3]`, literals
such as `[1, 2, 3]`, and repeat literals such as `[0; 8]`. Safe indexing is
bounds-checked, and array elements are dropped deterministically when the array
owner is dropped. `[T; N]` means fixed-size inline storage inside the owner, not
"always stack". A local fixed array is a stack allocation candidate, while a
fixed array inside a heap-owned value lives inline inside that heap allocation.
Large fixed arrays can later use an explicit owned heap placement flow such as
`[0; 1000000] -> heap() -> buffer`.

Dynamic arrays use a Rust `Vec<T>`-like internal model, but the SmallLang source
surface is `[T; ~]`. The value owns payload storage, length, and capacity. Heap
storage is the normal placement; D063 later permits proven local readonly
literals to use stack storage. Moving a dynamic array moves ownership of the
buffer. Dropping a dynamic array deallocates heap-placed storage only. A dynamic
array is not implicitly copied, reference-counted, or garbage-collected.

Dynamic array literals use an open tail marker:

```smalllang
[1, 2, 3, ~] => values!
```

SmallLang should not use `{ ... }` for dynamic arrays. Braces already delimit
blocks and remain the better future fit for dictionaries or maps. Dynamic arrays
stay in the `[]` syntax family and use `..` to mean open/growable.

Memory leak prevention is a compile-time guarantee for safe SmallLang, not a
best-effort runtime convention. If the compiler cannot prove ownership,
lifetime, and drop coverage for an allocation, the program does not compile.
Leak prevention is based on deterministic ownership, not GC:

- every owned array has one owner at a time;
- leaving a drop scope recursively drops initialized elements and frees owned
  heap storage;
- moving an owned value transfers the drop obligation and makes the source
  binding unusable;
- slices never deallocate and cannot outlive the owner they borrow from;
- a dynamic array cannot reallocate while an element or slice borrow into its
  buffer is active;
- safe code does not expose raw `alloc/free` ownership pairs;
- arrays do not use implicit shared ownership, so cyclic ownership leaks are not
  part of the first safe model;
- safe code cannot allocate without immediately capturing the allocation in an
  owned value;
- safe code cannot expose raw `alloc/free`, raw owning pointers, `forget`, or
  `leak`;
- features that cannot preserve compile-time leak freedom remain outside the
  safe language surface until a static model exists.

Borrowed slices are the common parameter type for read-only array APIs. A
function that only reads elements should prefer `&[T]` so it can accept a static
array, dynamic array, or sub-slice without taking ownership. Mutating APIs that
can change dynamic array length or capacity require `&mut [T; ~]`.

SmallLang should introduce explicit mutable bindings with the existing
flow-first binding direction:

```smalllang
[Int; ~] => values!
values! -> push(10)
99 => values![1]
```

Array support should also extend value-flow target calls to allow additional
arguments. The value on the left remains the primary first argument, and
parentheses on the target may contain extra arguments:

```smalllang
values! -> push(10)
values! -> reserve(1024)
```

The callee signature decides whether the flowed value is moved, shared-borrowed,
or mutably borrowed. For example, `len` can accept `&[T]`, while `push` accepts
`&mut [T; ~], T`.

The first implementation slice should stay narrow: `Int` static arrays,
read-only indexing, array `each`/`fold`, and `value => name!`. `[Int; ~]`,
mutable indexing, slice borrowing, and dynamic array growth can follow once the
compiler has the basic ownership and borrow checks in place. `pop`, `get`, and
fallible allocation APIs should wait until `Option` and `Result` exist.

The detailed draft is in `docs/ARRAYS.md`.

## D044 - Web-Reviewed Array And Flow Call Syntax Direction

Status: working decision
Date: 2026-07-09

Follow-up web research confirms that the D043 array shape is the right base:
Rust's `[T; N]`, borrowed slices, and `Vec<T>` ownership model are the strongest
mainstream reference points for a no-GC static/dynamic array design. However,
SmallLang's safe surface must be stricter than Rust because Rust explicitly
allows leak-safe constructs such as `mem::forget` and can leak through
reference-count cycles. SmallLang should therefore keep safe `forget`, safe
`leak`, raw owning allocation, implicit shared ownership, and unproven cyclic
ownership out of the safe language surface.

Zig is a useful allocator reference because it makes allocation explicit and
keeps memory-management responsibility visible, but that is not enough for
SmallLang's goal: safe SmallLang must statically prove owner/drop coverage
rather than leaving leak prevention to programmer discipline or test-time leak
detection. Austral's linear-resource checking is a better reference for the
strict part of the design: values that own resources must be consumed exactly
once, and a function cannot return while owned linear resources remain
unconsumed.

The same research argues against using `func!` as the ordinary function-call
marker. Rust already uses `name!(...)` for macros, Elixir uses trailing bang for
raising function variants, and Julia uses trailing bang for mutating functions.
SmallLang should avoid assigning ordinary function-call meaning to `!`.

The preferred next syntax direction is to remove empty parentheses from
value-flow calls when the left value is the only explicit input:

```smalllang
getName() => name
7 -> square => num
values -> len => count
```

Parentheses remain useful when additional arguments are present:

```smalllang
values! -> push(10)
values! -> reserve(1024)
```

This supersedes the design direction of D036 for future work. The important
correction is that `->` must not also mean binding. Result binding is separated
to `=>`, so `->` can remain a fluent pipeline/call operator and `=>` can mean
binding, definition, or pattern-result resolution.

## D045 - Fluent Flow Calls And Fat-Arrow Binding

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-09

SmallLang now gives the two arrows separate jobs:

```text
->   flow/apply/transform
=>   bind/define/resolve
```

The parser accepts receiver-only value-flow calls without empty parentheses:

```smalllang
7 -> square => num
"Hello, $num" -> println
```

The previous empty-parentheses flow form remains accepted as compatibility
syntax for a function that receives the flowed value:

```smalllang
7 -> square() => num
```

Statement-level bindings now use `=>`:

```smalllang
getName => name
n * i => value
1..100 -> fold 0 sum, i {
    sum + i
} => total
```

The old implicit final flow binding form is no longer part of the preferred
semantic model. A bare target after `->` is resolved as a flow target, not as a
new binding. This keeps `->` visually close to fluent APIs and functional
pipelines, while avoiding the ambiguity where `value -> name` might be read as
either a call or a binding.

Single-expression function bodies and compact `when` arms now prefer `=>`:

```smalllang
square: Int -> Int => it * it

grade: Int -> Text => when {
    90..100 => "A"
    else => "F"
}
```

The implementation changed the lexer, generated parser logic, semantic flow
checking, LLVM emission, standard library source, and examples. The parser still
accepts old `-> expression` function bodies and `value -> function()` flow
targets as compatibility syntax in this slice.

## D046 - Dollar String Interpolation And Literal Braces

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-09

String interpolation now uses `$name` for the common identifier case and
`$(expr)` for general expressions:

```smalllang
"Hello, $name"
"next = $(score + 1)"
"object = { name: $name, score: $score }"
```

Literal `{` and `}` characters in string literals are ordinary text and do not
need an escape form. This intentionally removes brace-based interpolation from
the preferred language surface because braces are common in JSON-like text,
CSS-like text, block syntax, and future dictionary/set syntax.

The parser represents interpolation as expression segments. `$name` is parsed
as a `NameExpression`, while `$(expr)` is parsed by the same expression parser
used by normal SmallLang source. Semantic analysis checks that interpolated
expressions are displayable (`Text` or `Int` in the current slice), and LLVM
emission writes each interpolated value with the normal runtime value output
path.

## D047 - First Int Containers With Deterministic Native Drop

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-09

SmallLang now has the first `Int` container slice:

```smalllang
[1, 2, 3] => numbers
[10, 20, ~] => values!
{ 1: 100, 2: 200 } => scores!
```

The implemented surface includes fixed `Int` arrays, growable `Int` arrays,
`{Int: Int}` dictionaries, checked indexing, `len`, `capacity`, dynamic-array
`push(value)`, dictionary `put(key, value)`, array `each`, array `fold`, and
`value => name!` mutable owner bindings.

Heap-owning containers must be created directly at a binding site in this
slice. This is intentionally strict: the compiler must know the owner so it can
emit exactly one deterministic drop at scope exit. Windows and Linux native
targets lower dynamic arrays and dictionaries through explicit allocation/free
runtime primitives. Browser WebAssembly rejects heap-owning containers until a
linear-memory allocator exists for that target.

The D047 implementation was not the final container model. Generic element
types, slices, ownership moves, container parameters/returns, and full nested
drop scopes were left as future work at that point.

## D048 - Move-Consuming Container Transforms Return New Owners

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-09

`!` on an owning binding name means that owner may be changed in place. It does
not mean SmallLang objects are mutable by default. Immutable bindings remain the
default:

```smalllang
[1, 2, ~] => values
values -> append(3) => values
values -> updated(0, 9) => values
```

The implemented immutable operations are:

- `array -> append(value) => nextArray`
- `array -> updated(index, value) => nextArray`
- `dictionary -> updated(key, value) => nextDictionary`

These operations consume a named source owner and bind the moved owner as the
result. After the transform, the source binding is no longer live. The target
may reuse the same name, as in `values -> append(3) => values`, because the old
owner is consumed before the new owner is bound.

The native lowering reuses storage when it can:

- dynamic-array `append` reuses spare capacity or grows/free-replaces the
  buffer when full
- dynamic-array `updated` performs a bounds check and writes into the moved
  buffer
- dictionary `updated` reuses the existing `put` path, updating in place or
  appending/growing as needed

These are not structure-sharing persistent collections yet, because implicit
shared ownership would complicate compile-time leak freedom.

The result of `append` or `updated` must be bound directly with `=>`. It cannot
be used as an anonymous intermediate flow target, because a heap-owning
temporary without a stable binding would not yet have a proven drop point in
the current compiler slice.

## D049 - Functional First Container Transforms Must Carry Optimization Notes

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-09

The first `append` and `updated` implementation copied initialized container
storage into a new owner. That was intentionally a functional-first
implementation, not the final speed or memory model. It has now been replaced
with move-consuming lowering for unique owned containers.

The old tradeoff was explicit:

- Copying on every immutable `append` is correct but can be O(n) per append.
- Repeated append through this path can become O(n^2).
- Dictionary `updated` used to copy all entries before changing one entry.
- This was accepted only to establish source-level immutable owner semantics,
  checked access, and deterministic drop behavior before move/borrow checking
  and shared structural nodes exist.

Implemented optimization direction:

- `values -> append(3) => nextValues` consumes `values`; after that move,
  `values` is unusable unless the same name is immediately rebound.
- If the buffer has capacity, lowering appends in place and transfers ownership
  to `nextValues`; if capacity is full, it grows and frees the old allocation.
- Dynamic-array `updated` and dictionary `updated` mutate the moved owner in
  place where possible.

Remaining future direction:

- Preserve `push`, `put`, and indexed assignment as the explicit `=> name!`
  in-place mutation surface.
- Add builder/transient containers for efficient bulk construction while still
  producing immutable final owners.
- If multiple immutable versions must remain alive and share storage, introduce
  a separate persistent container design rather than silently turning ordinary
  growable arrays into shared structures. HAMT/RRB-vector-style designs are
  candidates, but they require an explicit static ownership/drop story in
  SmallLang because there is no garbage collector.
- Add benchmarks before replacing the lowering: repeated append, random update,
  iteration/fold throughput, and dictionary update/lookup.

General coding rule: a feature may be implemented functionally first, but if
speed or memory work is intentionally deferred, the implementation must leave a
durable optimization note in the repo that names the tradeoff and the intended
follow-up direction.

## D050 - Dictionaries Use Scalar Swiss-Style Hash Tables

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-09

SmallLang's `{Int: Int}` dictionary lowering no longer uses a contiguous
key-value buffer with linear search. The runtime representation is now one heap
allocation owned by the dictionary handle:

```text
base pointer
len
capacity

allocation layout:
  control bytes: capacity bytes
  padding: align entries to 8 bytes
  entries: capacity slots, each slot = key i64 + value i64
```

Control byte `0` means empty. A full slot stores a nonzero 7-bit `h2`
fingerprint derived from the key hash. Lookup hashes the key, chooses the start
slot from `h1`, probes linearly, filters candidates by `h2`, and compares the
actual key only for matching fingerprints. This follows the SwissTable family
shape used by Rust/hashbrown, Abseil, and Go's newer map design, but the first
SmallLang implementation scans scalar control bytes instead of SIMD groups.

`put` and dictionary `updated` share the same path:

- existing keys update in place
- missing keys insert into the first empty probed slot
- insertion grows when `(len + 1) / capacity` would exceed 75%
- growth doubles capacity, allocates a new single buffer, rehashes live entries,
  and frees the old buffer

This preserves the no-GC ownership story: moving the dictionary moves one base
pointer and one drop obligation, and scope exit frees exactly that allocation.
The next performance step is target-specific grouped/SIMD control-byte probing,
not another semantic change.

## D051 - LLVM Emitter Name And Partial Boundaries

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-09

The main LLVM emitter was renamed from `ConsoleLlvmEmitter` to `LlvmEmitter`.
The old name was no longer accurate after the same emitter became responsible
for Windows, Linux, browser WebAssembly, heap-owning containers, file/runtime
intrinsics, and target-independent source-language lowering.

The class is intentionally split into partial files by responsibility:

- `LlvmEmitter.cs` keeps shared state, construction, and the top-level `Emit`
  orchestration.
- `LlvmEmitter.FunctionDeclarations.cs` emits user function definitions.
- `LlvmEmitter.FunctionCalls.cs` handles function-call lowering and inlining.
- `LlvmEmitter.Statements.cs` emits main statements and block-function calls.
- `LlvmEmitter.Expressions.*.cs` emits scalar expressions, conditionals,
  folds, and phi construction.
- `LlvmEmitter.Flow.cs` owns value-flow lowering.
- `LlvmEmitter.Containers*.cs` owns array/dictionary layout, indexing,
  ownership-moving transforms, and hash-table operations.
- `LlvmEmitter.Runtime*.cs` owns runtime helper IR and runtime intrinsic calls.
- `LlvmEmitter.Utilities.cs` keeps local runtime value records and small shared
  helpers.

This is a structural refactor only. It does not change emitted IR semantics.
Future emitter work should add code to the closest partial by behavior instead
of growing one monolithic file again.

## D052 - Bang-Suffixed Mutable Owners And Indexed Assignment

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-10

Mutable owner bindings now use a `!` suffix on the local name:

```smalllang
[Int; ~] => values!
values! -> push(10)
99 => values![0]
```

The suffix is part of the binding name. That makes mutability visible at every
use site, instead of requiring a reader to remember that an earlier declaration
used a hidden modifier. The older modifier-before-name spelling is removed from
the language surface rather than kept as compatibility syntax.

The choice follows the broad convention used by Julia, Ruby, Scheme, and
Clojure-family code where `!` marks destructive mutation or stateful change,
but applies it to SmallLang's mutable owner name instead of ordinary function
names. This avoids spending `!` on normal calls and keeps `-> push` readable as
a receiver operation while the receiver itself carries the mutation signal.

Indexed assignment is now implemented for current `Int` containers:

```smalllang
[1, 2, 3] => fixed!
99 => fixed![1]

[10, 20, ~] => values!
77 => values![1]

{ 1: 100, 2: 200 } => scores!
250 => scores![2]
```

Array indexed assignment performs the same bounds check as indexed reads.
Dictionary indexed assignment updates an existing key and traps if the key is
missing; insertion remains the job of `put`, and owner-returning insert/update
remains the job of `updated`.

## D053 - Typed Empty Int Containers

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-10

SmallLang now supports typed empty literals for the current `Int` container
slice:

```smalllang
[Int; ~] => values!
{Int: Int} => scores!
```

`[Int; ~]` creates an empty growable `Int` array owner with length and capacity
zero. It gives the source surface a stable typed form before generic arrays
arrive.

`{Int: Int}` creates an empty `{Int: Int}` dictionary owner with the initial
hash-table allocation. This removes the previous need to seed dictionaries with
a dummy entry such as `{ 0: 0 }` before calling `put`.

Only `Int` element/key/value types are accepted in this slice. Generic
`[T; ~]` and `{K: V}` remain future work.

## D054 - Tilde Growable Array Marker And Capacity Hints

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-10

Growable arrays now use `~` instead of the earlier array-specific `..` marker:

```smalllang
[Int; ~] => values!
[Int; 1024~] => buffered!
[1, 2, ~] => seeded!
{Int: Int; 1024~} => scores!
```

`~` means the container is open/growable. `N~` means the initial capacity should
be at least `N` elements while the initial length remains zero for typed empty
containers. The parser no longer accepts the previous bracket-dot-dot array
forms. The `..` token remains reserved for inclusive ranges such as `1..9`.

## D055 - Block-Local Drop Scopes For Owned Containers

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-10

Heap-owning containers may now be created inside nested blocks. The compiler
drops block-local growable arrays and dictionaries at the end of the block:

```smalllang
1..3 -> each i {
    [Int; 2~] => row!
    row! -> push(i)
}
```

When the block's final expression returns a block-local owner, the block does
not drop that owner. Ownership and the drop obligation move to the surrounding
binding:

```smalllang
true -> if {
    [Int; 2~] => values!
    values! -> push(10)
    values!
} else {
    [Int; 2~] => values!
    values! -> push(20)
    values!
} => selected!
```

The implementation is intentionally conservative. A block result may move a
growable array or dictionary created inside that block, or the result of a
move-consuming transform from such a block-local owner. Moving an owner from an
outer scope through an inner block result is rejected for now, because that
would create an implicit alias unless broader move analysis consumes the outer
binding. Static array block results are also rejected in this slice.

## D056 - Owned Container Function Returns

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-10

User functions may now return growable array and dictionary owners:

```smalllang
makeValues: -> [Int; ~] {
    [Int; 4~] => values!
    values! -> push(10)
    values!
}

main {
    makeValues() => values!
}
```

The function body may contain statements before its final expression. If the
final expression returns a heap-owning container, the function does not drop
that owner; the drop obligation moves to the caller. The caller must bind the
returned owner directly so the compiler has a deterministic drop point.

The same rule applies to `{Int: Int}`. Function return values use small runtime
handles containing pointer, length, and capacity. Anonymous use of a returned
owned container as a flow source, such as `makeValues() -> len`, is rejected in
this slice because no owner binding would exist to receive the drop obligation.

## D057 - Owned Container Function Parameters

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-10

User functions may now accept growable array and dictionary owners:

```smalllang
sumValues values: move [Int; ~] -> Int {
    values -> fold 0 sum, value {
        sum + value
    }
}

main {
    [1, 2, 3, ~] => values!
    values! -> sumValues => total
}
```

Passing `move [Int; ~]` or `move {Int: Int}` moves ownership into the callee.
The caller's source binding is removed after the call, and the callee owns the
drop obligation for that parameter. Both direct calls such as
`sumValues(values!)` and value-flow calls such as `values! -> sumValues` are
supported.

This slice is intentionally move-only and explicit. A heap-owning container
parameter without `move`, such as `[Int; ~]`, is rejected so ordinary parameter
syntax remains available for readonly views.

## D058 - Readonly Int View Function Parameters

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-10

User functions may now accept `[Int]` as a non-owning readonly view:

```smalllang
sumValues values: [Int] -> Int {
    values -> fold 0 sum, value {
        sum + value
    }
}

main {
    [Int; 4~] => values!
    values! -> push(10)
    values! -> push(20)

    values! -> sumValues => total
    values! -> len => count
}
```

`[Int]` does not own or drop storage. Static `Int` arrays and growable `Int`
arrays can be passed as `[Int]` by lowering them to a small `{ptr, len}` view.
The caller keeps ownership, so the source binding remains usable after the
call. The callee can use indexing, `len`, `each`, and `fold`; mutation and
owner-moving operations remain unavailable on the view.

The view is deliberately limited to function input in this slice. Returning or
storing `[Int]` is rejected until the compiler has a broader borrow-lifetime
model that can prove the view cannot outlive its owner.

## D059 - Mutable Growable Int Array Function Parameters

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-10

User functions may now accept `mut [Int; ~]` as a non-owning mutable borrow:

```smalllang
addTail values: mut [Int; ~] -> Unit {
    values -> push(30)
}

main {
    [Int; 4~] => values!
    values! -> push(10)
    values! -> addTail
    values! -> len => count
}
```

The caller must pass a named mutable growable-array owner such as `values!`.
The callee receives access to the caller's mutable owner handle, so operations
such as `push` and indexed assignment update the original owner without moving
ownership. The caller keeps the owner after the call.

The implementation lowers the mutable borrow to a small runtime handle
containing addresses of the caller's pointer, length, and capacity slots. The
callee registers those addresses as its local mutable slot, and borrowed
parameters are excluded from deterministic drop emission so the owner is still
dropped exactly once by the caller.

This initial slice supports mutable borrows only for `[Int; ~]`. D060 extends
the same model to `{Int: Int}` dictionaries. Nested borrow conflict tracking and
returning or storing mutable borrows remain future work.

## D060 - Mutable Int Dictionary Function Parameters

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-10

User functions may accept `mut {Int: Int}` as a non-owning mutable borrow:

```smalllang
addScore scores: mut {Int: Int} -> Unit {
    scores -> put(3, 300)
}

main {
    {Int: Int; 4~} => scores!
    scores! -> put(1, 100)
    scores! -> addScore
    scores! -> len => count
}
```

As with `mut [Int; ~]`, the caller must pass a named mutable owner and keeps
ownership after the call. The callee may use `put` and indexed assignment, may
observe the updated pointer, length, and capacity after hash-table growth, and
never drops the borrowed dictionary.

Both mutable container kinds use the same runtime handle containing addresses
of the caller's pointer, length, and capacity slots. The bound parameter keeps
its concrete container type, so array-only operations such as `push` and
dictionary-only operations such as `put` remain statically separated.

## D061 - Returning Consumed Container Parameters

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-10

A function may return its own `move [Int; ~]` or `move {Int: Int}` input rather
than dropping it at function exit:

```smalllang
appendTail values: move [Int; ~] -> [Int; ~] {
    values -> append(30) => values
    values
}

main {
    [1, 2, ~] => values
    values -> appendTail => values
}
```

Direct return, same-name rebinding after `append` or `updated`, direct calls,
and value-flow calls all transfer the drop obligation to the caller's result
binding. The caller's source owner becomes unavailable as soon as the call
consumes it. Ignoring an owned result remains a compile-time error.

For `if` and `when` results, every return branch must transfer the same move
input or no branch may transfer it. Mixed paths are rejected because an
unconditional function-exit drop would otherwise either leak or double-drop.
When all paths transfer the input, LLVM emission omits the parameter drop and
returns the merged owner value; otherwise normal function-exit cleanup remains.

## D062 - Readonly Dictionary Parameters And Handle-Only Calls

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-10

An undecorated `{Int: Int}` function input is a readonly non-owning view:

```smalllang
findScore scores: {Int: Int} -> Int {
    scores[2]
}

main {
    { 1: 100, 2: 200 } => scores
    scores -> findScore => score
    scores[1] => stillOwnedHere
}
```

This completes the parameter policy: undecorated input is readonly, `mut`
grants mutation for the call, and `move` transfers ownership. A readonly
dictionary parameter has its own semantic/runtime view type, so `put`, indexed
assignment, `updated`, return, and storage are rejected without relying on
conventions. The callee never emits a drop for the view.

The ABI representation remains `%smalllang.int_dictionary = { ptr, i64, i64 }`.
Only this three-word handle is passed by value; the Swiss-style table stays in
its existing owner storage. D064 later permits proven local readonly literals
to use stack storage. The call itself performs no dictionary copy, allocation,
rehash, reference-count update, or free. LLVM is free to pass the handle words
in registers or use stack slots according to the native ABI.

The baseline placement policy is intentionally concrete: local `[Int; N]`
storage is inline, while growable arrays and dictionaries normally keep only
their owner handles in local state and allocate payloads on the heap. D063 and
D064 later add automatic stack placement for proven local readonly literals.
Moving heap-placed containers copies the handle, not the payload. Very large
fixed arrays still need an explicit heap-placement feature or future compiler
placement policy before they should be used as large local values.

As part of D062, typed empty `{Int: Int}` values without a capacity hint now use
the same lazy-allocation rule as `[Int; ~]`: `{ null, 0, 0 }` is stored in the
owner handle, and the first `put` allocates capacity 4. An empty dictionary that
is only inspected or passed as a readonly view therefore performs zero heap
allocations. Explicit capacity syntax such as `{Int: Int; 1024~}` still
preallocates because the programmer requested that tradeoff.

## D063 - Automatic Stack Promotion For Readonly Dynamic Arrays

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-10

Small dynamic-array literals keep their existing `[Int; ~]` source type and
syntax, but their payload may be placed on the stack when the compiler proves
that the owner remains local and readonly:

```smalllang
sumValues values: [Int] -> Int {
    values -> fold 0 sum, value { sum + value }
}

main {
    [10, 20, 30, ~] => values
    values -> sumValues => total
    values[1] => middle
}
```

Placement analysis currently promotes a direct, nonempty dynamic-array literal
bound to an immutable top-level local in `main` or a non-inline user function.
Every later use must be checked indexing, `len`, `capacity`, `each`, `fold`, or
a call through a readonly `[Int]` parameter. A mutable binding, `move`,
`append`, `updated`, function-result escape, or any unrecognized owner use keeps
the normal heap representation.

The first implementation applies a cumulative 4096-byte payload budget per
analyzed function frame. It intentionally excludes local/standard-library
inline functions and block-function bodies, where call-site inlining or loop
execution could otherwise place a dynamic `alloca` repeatedly in one frame.
This is an optimizer placement policy, not a source-language fallback.

LLVM lowering uses `alloca [N x i64]` for a promoted payload while preserving
the dynamic-array `ptr`, `len`, and `capacity` interface used by indexing and
readonly slices. Runtime values track whether payload storage is stack or heap;
scope cleanup emits `smalllang_free` only for heap storage. Example 38 verifies
both the program output and LLVM requirements: the stack allocation must be
present, while calls to `smalllang_alloc` and `smalllang_free` must be absent.
Because this path needs no allocator, the same example also compiles for the
browser WebAssembly target.

## D064 - Automatic Stack Promotion For Readonly Int Dictionaries

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-10

Small nonempty `{Int: Int}` literals now join dynamic arrays in automatic
storage placement analysis:

```smalllang
findScore scores: {Int: Int} -> Int {
    scores[2]
}

main {
    { 1: 100, 2: 200, 3: 300 } => scores
    scores -> findScore => second
    scores -> len => count
}
```

The compiler promotes the literal only when it is bound to an immutable
top-level local in `main` or a non-inline user function and every later owner
use is checked lookup, `len`, `capacity`, or a call through a readonly
`{Int: Int}` parameter. Mutable bindings, `put`, `updated`, `move`, function
result escape, and unrecognized uses retain heap placement.

The promoted Swiss table is one `alloca [N x i8]` aligned to 8 bytes. `N`
includes control bytes, control-to-entry alignment padding, and 16 bytes for
each key/value slot. The compiler zeroes only the control-byte region before
inserting literal entries. Runtime dictionary values track stack versus heap
storage, and deterministic drop emits `smalllang_free` only for heap storage.

D063's 4096-byte function-frame budget is now shared by promoted dynamic-array
and dictionary payloads. The dictionary's full table allocation, rather than
only its live entry count, is charged to that budget. Example 39 checks the
expected 72-byte and 136-byte stack blocks and rejects generated calls to
`smalllang_alloc` or `smalllang_free`. It also compiles for browser WebAssembly
without adding a linear-memory allocator.

## D065 - Lifetime-Based Function Stack-Frame Planning

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-10

Stack-promoted dynamic-array and dictionary payloads are no longer allocated at
the source binding's current LLVM block. The semantic placement pass assigns
each candidate a creation position, last-use position, size, and lifetime-end
unit. A linear-scan frame allocator assigns non-overlapping intervals to the
same physical slot and charges only the final slot sizes against the 4096-byte
frame budget.

Every physical slot is emitted once in the function `entry` block as an aligned
`alloca [N x i8]`. Literal construction emits `llvm.lifetime.start`; the last
statement or block-result expression that can use the owner emits
`llvm.lifetime.end`. A loop-local literal therefore reuses the same entry slot
on every iteration instead of executing a new `alloca` inside the loop.

The analysis recursively indexes `if`, `when`, fold bodies, built-in block
function bodies, and loop bodies. Branches occupy disjoint static position
ranges, while an owner live across a complete control expression spans its
nested ranges and prevents unsafe reuse. Storage placement remains conservative:
any mutation, move, growth, owner escape, or unrecognized use retains heap
placement.

Example 40 proves that a 24-byte array, a later 72-byte Swiss dictionary, and a
16-byte loop-local array all reuse `%stack_slot0 = alloca [72 x i8]`. Its LLVM
fixture requires all three lifetime sizes and rejects `%stack_slot1`, allocator
calls, and free calls. Local/standard-library inline function bodies, fixed
arrays, and mutable-container handle slots remain separate follow-up work.

Local functions and standard-library SmallLang wrappers are emitted inline and
therefore have no independent runtime frame. Their placement plans are now
merged into each containing non-inline function or `main` frame with dedicated
slot ranges. Repeated inline calls restart and end lifetime on the same entry
slot. If adding an inline plan would exceed the 4096-byte frame budget, its
container candidates conservatively remain heap-placed. Example 41 verifies a
local function called inside a loop with one 16-byte entry slot and repeated
lifetime markers.

Fixed arrays now participate in the same physical frame plan. Small literals
and `[value; N]` repetitions use entry slots even when created in nested loops.
If their complete inline byte size does not fit the remaining planned frame
budget, lowering allocates owned heap storage instead and deterministic drop
frees it. Example 42 verifies a 64-byte fixed array on the stack and a
4,800-byte fixed array on the heap without an `alloca [600 x i64]`.

Mutable dynamic-array and dictionary owners also reserve their three-word
`ptr`/`len`/`capacity` metadata as one 24-byte planned entry slot. Scope drop or
ownership transfer ends that slot's lifetime after the final metadata load.
Example 30 verifies that loop-local mutable owners repeatedly reuse one metadata
slot and that legacy `%mutable_ptr_addr` allocas are absent.

## D066 - Nominal Inline Structs And Static Methods

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-10

User-defined `struct` declarations are nominal value types. The semantic model
assigns every declaration a stable compilation-local `TypeId` and stores field
definitions in one type table. Struct literals must initialize every declared
field exactly once; unknown, duplicate, missing, and incorrectly typed fields
are compile errors. Inline recursive cycles are rejected until an explicit
heap reference type can break the size cycle.

```smalllang
struct Point {
    x: Int
    y: Int
}

impl Point {
    translated: self -> Self {
        Point { x: self.x + 10, y: self.y + 20 }
    }
}
```

LLVM lowering uses named aggregate types such as
`%smalllang.struct.1024 = type { i64, i64 }`. Literals use `insertvalue`, field
reads use `extractvalue`, and user functions pass and return the aggregate
directly. This representation introduces no object header, heap allocation,
reference counting, garbage collection, or vtable.

`impl` methods are registered as type-qualified functions and resolved from the
receiver's nominal type. Both `point.translated` and `point -> translated`
lower to direct statically selected function calls. Readonly `self` is the first
implemented receiver mode; mutable and consuming receivers remain separate
ownership slices. Example 43 verifies nested structs, `Text` fields, dot and
flow method calls, output, LLVM aggregate shape, and absence of allocator/free
calls. Diagnostic fixtures verify complete initialization, field typing, and
recursive-size rejection.

Generated functions use the `nounwind` attribute but no longer carry the
prototype-era `noinline optnone` attributes. Windows `-O3` and Linux/WebAssembly
`-Oz` compilation can therefore inline statically resolved methods, scalarize
aggregate values, eliminate temporary copies, and devirtualize any later
provably concrete dynamic calls.

## D067 - Parenthesis-Free Queries And Payload Enums

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-10

SmallLang avoids empty call parentheses. A readonly method with no additional
arguments is a computed member and uses uniform member access:

```smalllang
point.translated
point -> translated
counter! -> increment
```

Stored fields and computed members share one namespace and cannot have the same
name. Dot syntax is reserved for stored data and readonly query-like members;
mutation and other actions use value-flow syntax. Parentheses remain available
only when a call carries actual arguments. Calling a zero-argument method as
`point.translated()` is a compile error with the canonical spelling in the
diagnostic.

This combines Scala's parameterless uniform-access rule, Swift-style computed
properties, and SmallLang's existing flow calls. It keeps query expressions
compact without hiding mutation or ownership transfer behind property syntax.

User `enum` declarations are tagged unions with optional per-variant payloads.
Payload constructors use `Reading.Value(42)`, while payload-free variants use
`Reading.Missing` without empty parentheses. LLVM represents an enum as an
inline tag plus an aligned maximum-size payload area; it has no object header,
heap allocation, or vtable.

Subject `when` supports variant patterns and payload bindings. Omitting `else`
requires every variant exactly once; missing and duplicate variants are compile
errors. An `else` arm is permitted only when explicit patterns do not already
cover every variant. Example 44 verifies `Int`, empty, and `Text` variants,
payload extraction, scalar/text phi results, runtime output, and no allocator
calls.

## D068 - Associated Members And Explicit Self Modes

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-10

An `impl` member without `self` is statically associated with its type.
Zero-argument constructors use computed type-member syntax, while constructors
with an actual argument keep parentheses:

```smalllang
Point.origin
Point.fromX(5)
```

Readonly `self` remains the default and uses an inline aggregate value. `mut
self` receives an address to an explicitly mutable owner and can update fields
with the normal assignment direction, for example `next => self.value`. Only
mutable struct bindings become addressable stack values; immutable structs stay
in SSA aggregate form. A call such as `counter! -> increment` passes the stack
address directly and introduces no heap allocation.

`move self` consumes the receiver. Inline user values are passed by value, the
source binding is removed after the call, and any later use is a compile error.
This preserves the language-wide rule that readonly is the default while
mutation and ownership transfer are explicit at the declaration and call-flow
boundaries. Example 45 verifies mutable field updates, pointer ABI, consuming
self, use-after-move rejection, and absence of allocator/free calls.

## D069 - Nominal Traits And Monomorphized Type Generics

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-10

Traits declare nominal method contracts and are implemented explicitly:

```smalllang
trait Measure {
    measure: self -> Int
}

impl Measure for Point {
    measure: self -> Int { self.x + self.y }
}
```

Trait conformance checks method presence, receiver ownership, and return type.
An unambiguous `point.measure` or explicit `point -> Measure.measure` resolves to
the concrete implementation function. No trait metadata, object header, fat
pointer, or vtable is emitted for this static path.

One checked type parameter and optional trait bound are supported on global
functions:

```smalllang
identity<T> value: T -> T { value }
measureOf<T: Measure> value: T -> Int { value -> Measure.measure }
```

Every used concrete type produces a separately checked specialization. Trait
bounds are proven before specialization, and the specialized body is then
type-checked with the concrete binding types. LLVM receives direct functions
such as `identity$Point`, `identity$Int`, and `measureOf$Point`; calls do not use
type erasure or runtime dispatch. Example 46 verifies direct trait dispatch and
example 47 verifies multiple monomorphizations plus bound failure diagnostics.

## D070 - Explicit Box And Recursive Drop Glue

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-10

`box T` is an explicit owning heap reference. `box value` allocates exactly the
inline size and alignment of `T`; ordinary structs and enums remain inline and
do not acquire an object header. A boxed field or enum payload breaks recursive
inline sizing, so definitions such as `enum Chain { End; More(box Chain) }` are
finite and statically laid out.

Owned values cannot be copied into a second binding. The default function input
is a readonly borrow even when the value transitively contains a box, while
`move box T` and `move` user values transfer ownership and invalidate the source
binding. This keeps readonly access as the unadorned path and makes ownership
transfer explicit.

The compiler emits type-specific internal drop functions for reachable owned
user types. Struct drop glue visits owned fields, enum drop glue switches on the
active tag, and box drop glue recursively drops the pointee before calling
`smalllang_free`. These helpers are statically selected by concrete type and do
not use metadata or vtables. Examples 48 and 49 verify single-owner box transfer,
readonly repeated access, recursive enum destruction, copy rejection, and
use-after-move rejection.

## D071 - Explicit Compile-Time Int Value Generics

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-11

A global function may declare one compile-time `Int` value parameter:

```smalllang
sumFilled<N: Int> value: Int -> Int {
    [value; N] => values
    values -> fold 0 total, item { total + item }
}
```

The value argument is explicit at the fluent call boundary, such as
`7 -> sumFilled<3>`. It is not passed at runtime. Every used value produces a
separately checked and emitted specialization, and symbolic fixed-repeat counts
become LLVM constants in that specialization. Omitting the value argument is a
compile error. Example 50 verifies distinct `3` and `5` specializations and
their fixed LLVM array shapes.

Value parameters also participate in fixed-array input types:

```smalllang
fixedLength<N: Int> values: [Int; N] -> Int {
    values -> len
}

[10, 20, 30] -> fixedLength<3>
```

`[Int; 3]` and `[Int; 5]` are distinct compile-time size contracts at this
boundary even though the readonly native ABI remains the compact `{ pointer,
length }` slice pair. The compiler proves that the fixed source length equals
the explicit specialization value before emitting a call. A dynamic array or a
fixed array with another length is rejected. Example 51 verifies the two valid
specializations and a `3` versus `4` size-mismatch diagnostic.

## D072 - Rooted Multi-File Compilation

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-11

A compiler invocation may contain multiple user `.sl` files. Every file parses
its own `namespace` and import aliases, then all declarations enter one semantic
compilation unit. Exactly one user file may contain executable top-level
statements; files without such statements are library modules. Example 52
compiles a namespaced library file and a separate root file into one executable
and verifies the direct namespaced LLVM call.

This is the first module-system substrate, not the final package model. The
compiler now follows non-`sys` imports from the root source directory by mapping
`sample.math` to `sample/math.sl`. Discovery is recursive and reports missing
files, declared-namespace mismatch, import cycles with the full chain, and
duplicate module declarations. The next slice adds internal-by-default
visibility and explicit public exports. The design follows Zig's explicit
root-module graph and Swift's module/API boundary while retaining SL namespace
and fluent-call syntax.

Module functions are internal by default. A caller in another module may use a
function only when its declaration begins with `public`; same-module calls and
local functions remain available without annotation. The parser records both
the declaration module and visibility, and semantic call resolution compares
them before code generation. Standard-library functions remain externally
visible through their bootstrap status. Example 52 marks `sample.math.double`
public, while the module-internal-access diagnostic proves that importing a
module does not expose its internal implementation functions.

The same internal-by-default boundary now applies to nominal structs, enums,
and traits. Their semantic identity is the module-qualified declaration name,
so two modules may own same-spelled types without collapsing them into one
type. Import aliases resolve in type annotations, `impl` headers, struct
literals, enum constructors, and qualified trait calls. Cross-module use
requires `public`; examples 53 and the internal-type/internal-trait diagnostics
exercise both the exported and rejected paths.

## D073 - Static Associated Types And Equality Constraints

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-11

Traits may declare compile-time type members and each implementation must bind
them explicitly:

```smalllang
trait Source {
    type Item
    read: self -> Item
}

impl Source for NumberSource {
    type Item = Int
    read: self -> Int { self.value }
}
```

An associated type is part of the static conformance contract; it does not add
a runtime field, metadata pointer, or vtable. Trait method signatures may name
the associated type, and implementation validation substitutes the concrete
binding before comparing the method signature. Generic bounds can require an
equality such as `<T: Source<Item = Int>>`. Monomorphization checks the selected
concrete implementation and rejects a different or missing binding before LLVM
emission. Example 54 verifies static dispatch through the constrained generic;
the associated-type diagnostics verify missing bindings and equality failure.

## D074 - Multi-Parameter Generic Inference

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-11

Generic functions may declare two compile-time type parameters. Constraints
that relate them use a separate `where` clause:

```smalllang
readAny<T, Item> where T: Source<Item = Item> value: T -> Item {
    value -> Source.read
}
```

The primary type is inferred from the flowed input. The secondary type is
inferred from the selected concrete implementation's associated-type binding.
Every resulting type tuple has its own checked monomorphization and LLVM
signature; no type descriptors are passed at runtime. A secondary parameter
that cannot be inferred is a compile error rather than an arbitrary default.
Example 55 verifies `(NumberSource, Int)` and `(TextSource, Text)` specializations
with different LLVM return ABIs, plus a no-vtable assertion.

## D075 - Typed Fixed-Array Layout Foundation

Status: implemented for `Int` and `Text`; broader `[T; N]` remains active
Date: 2026-07-11

Fixed array literals now infer one homogeneous element type instead of forcing
every element to `Int`. `Text` arrays allocate `N * 16` bytes, store LLVM
`%smalllang.text` values, return `Text` from checked indexing, expose `len`, and
release the backing buffer exactly once at owner-scope exit. Mixed element types
are rejected. This establishes the element-layout seam that future inline user
types and recursively owned values will extend; it does not yet claim complete
general `[T; N]` support. Example 56 verifies the `Text` layout, indexed value,
length, and allocation/free pair.

## D076 - Parametric Fixed Arrays For User Values

Status: implemented for copyable inline user values
Date: 2026-07-11

`TypeDefinitionTable` now creates a stable fixed-array type definition per
element `TypeId`. Each definition records element type, inline size, and
alignment. Homogeneous arrays of copyable structs and enums therefore lower to
typed LLVM aggregate GEP/store/load operations, and indexing recovers the exact
element type for subsequent field access or enum matching. The backing buffer
is an owned allocation released once at scope exit.

An element type that transitively owns a box or another heap value is rejected
for now. Accepting it without element-wise recursive drop would permit leaks or
double frees, so this remains outside safe SL until the next slice. Example 57
verifies distinct struct and payload-enum array layouts; the owned-element
diagnostic verifies the safety boundary.

## D077 - Recursive Drop For Owned Fixed-Array Elements

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-11

Parametric fixed arrays now accept elements that transitively own boxes or other
heap values. At owner-scope exit the emitter loads each initialized element,
calls its existing concrete struct/enum/box drop glue exactly once, and only
then frees the array backing allocation. Array types participate in owned-storage
classification, so rebinding by copy is rejected.

Indexing an owned element is deliberately rejected until move extraction can
invalidate the source slot and adjust drop coverage. Returning a copied aggregate
would create two owners and is therefore not admitted as a temporary shortcut.
Example 58 verifies two element-drop calls followed by one backing free; copy
and owned-index diagnostics verify the static ownership boundary.

## D078 - Parametric Growable Arrays

Status: implemented for scalar and user-value literals plus mutable `push`
Date: 2026-07-11

`TypeDefinitionTable` interns a dynamic-array definition per element `TypeId`,
recording element size and alignment. Typed empty arrays such as `[Text; 2~]`
and growable literals of `Text`, structs, enums, and owned user values retain
their element type through indexing, `len`, and `capacity`.

Mutable `push` checks the exact element type. Growth doubles capacity, allocates
`capacity * elementSize`, copies initialized aggregates with typed LLVM
load/store, frees the old backing buffer without dropping transferred elements,
then stores the new element. Final destruction iterates over runtime length,
calls recursive drop glue for owned elements, and frees the current backing
buffer. A named owned value cannot be pushed by implicit copy; a fresh value is
accepted as a direct ownership transfer until explicit move arguments exist.
Examples 59-61 verify `Text`, copyable struct, and owned struct arrays.

## D079 - Parametric Swiss-Table Dictionaries

Status: implemented for built-in `Int`/`Text` keys and inline value types
Date: 2026-07-11

Dictionary literals infer one homogeneous key type and one homogeneous value
type. `TypeDefinitionTable` interns each `Dictionary<K, V>` specialization and
records key/value size, alignment, value offset, and entry stride. The existing
Swiss-table control-byte scheme remains shared, while entry addressing and LLVM
load/store operations use the concrete K/V layouts.

`Int` keys retain their integer mixer. `Text` keys use deterministic byte-wise
FNV-1a hashing and length-plus-byte equality, so dictionary identity never
depends on text pointer identity. Checked lookup, mutable `put`, load-threshold
growth, and rehash preserve exact key/value types. Growth transfers entries to
the new table before freeing the old allocation. Final destruction walks live
control bytes, recursively drops owned key/value payloads exactly once, then
frees the table.

Examples 62-65 verify `Text -> Int`, `Int -> Text`, owned user-value payloads,
and typed-empty `Text -> Text` dictionaries. User-defined key types remain
closed until static `Hash` and `Eq` trait dispatch is wired into collection
specialization; generic dictionary function contracts and iterators remain the
next collection boundary.

## D080 - Parametric Dictionary Function Contracts

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-11

Concrete dictionary types may cross user-function boundaries without erasing
their K/V specialization. Function annotations use `{K: V}` directly. A
default input is a readonly borrow, `mut {K: V}` passes addressable owner-handle
slots, and `move {K: V}` transfers the owner and may return the same concrete
dictionary type.

All specializations share the three-word LLVM handle ABI `{ ptr, len,
capacity }`; key/value TypeIds and entry layouts remain compile-time metadata
and never become runtime descriptors. Readonly parameters are excluded from
drop ownership, mutable borrows update the caller's handle after growth, and
move parameters transfer exactly one final drop obligation. Example 66 verifies
readonly lookup, mutable insertion, and move-return for `{Text: Int}`. Separate
diagnostics reject mutation through a readonly parameter and calls with a
different dictionary specialization.

## D081 - Parametric Dynamic-Array Function Contracts

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-11

Concrete `[T; ~]` types now cross user-function boundaries with the same
ownership modes as other owned containers. A default parameter is readonly,
`mut [T; ~]` borrows addressable handle slots, and `move [T; ~]` transfers the
owner and may return the same element specialization.

Every specialization uses the three-word `%smalllang.dynamic_int_array` LLVM
handle ABI while the element TypeId, size, alignment, and recursive drop glue
remain compile-time facts. A mutable callee that grows the buffer writes the new
pointer/length/capacity back to the caller's owner slots. A move-return does not
drop the transferred parameter inside the callee; the caller receives the one
drop obligation. Example 67 verifies readonly/`mut`/`move` `[Text; ~]` calls and
growth. Example 68 verifies that an owned user-element array survives a move
round trip and recursively drops its elements exactly once at the final owner.

## D082 - Type-Preserving Array Each

Status: implemented for fixed and dynamic arrays
Date: 2026-07-12

The fluent block iterator `array -> each item { ... }` binds `item` to the
concrete array element type rather than forcing `Int`. Fixed and dynamic
`Text`, struct, enum, box, and other inline values use their typed LLVM load
path on every iteration. Range iteration remains `Int`.

An element that transitively owns storage is a readonly borrow from its array
slot for one block invocation. Block cleanup does not drop that borrowed item;
the array remains the sole owner and later performs its normal element-wise
recursive destruction. Existing semantic copy restrictions prevent rebinding
the borrowed owner by value. Example 69 verifies fixed `Text`, dynamic
copyable-struct, and dynamic owned-struct iteration without runtime type tables
or vtables.

## D083 - Swiss-Table Key And Value Iteration

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-12

Dictionaries expose two fluent block iterators:

```smalllang
symbols -> eachKey key { ... }
symbols -> eachValue value { ... }
```

Both scan the concrete table capacity and execute the block only for slots
whose Swiss control byte is nonzero. `eachKey` binds K and `eachValue` binds V,
using the specialization's exact offset, alignment, and LLVM load type. Table
order is deterministic for a given hash implementation but is not insertion
order and is not part of the source-level contract.

Transitively owned keys or values are readonly per-slot borrows. Iterator block
cleanup never drops them; the dictionary remains the sole owner and its final
live-control-byte scan performs recursive destruction. Example 70 verifies
`Text` keys, copyable struct values, and owned struct values. Diagnostics reject
owned iterator-item copying and dictionary iterators on non-dictionary sources.

## D084 - Static Hash And Equality-Key Dispatch

Status: implemented for copyable nominal keys
Date: 2026-07-12

A copyable struct or enum may become a dictionary key by implementing two
static traits with exact signatures:

```smalllang
trait Hash { hash: self -> Int }
trait Eq { eq: self -> Int }
```

`Hash.hash` returns the table hash. `Eq.eq` returns a canonical integer for the
key's equality class; two keys are equal exactly when those canonical integers
match. Implementations must obey the usual hash law: equal keys return the same
hash. This canonical-key form fits SL's current one-input function ABI. A later
general multi-argument function slice may add the familiar
`equals(self, other)` surface without changing dictionary storage.

Dictionary specialization verifies both conformances at compile time. LLVM
lookup, insertion, update, and rehash directly call the concrete impl functions;
there is no type descriptor, interface object, or vtable. Owned nominal keys are
rejected until temporary-key move/drop coverage is explicit. Example 71 verifies
nominal-key insertion, equality-based replacement, lookup, growth, and static
calls. Missing or incorrectly typed contracts are compile errors.

## D085 - Contextual Nominal-Key Literals

Status: implemented for dictionary indexing and literals
Date: 2026-07-12

When a dictionary's key type K is a nominal struct, an index expression may
omit the repeated type name:

```smalllang
symbols[{ scope: 1, id: 10 }]
```

The dictionary supplies the expected K type, so the brace expression is
contextually interpreted as `K { scope: 1, id: 10 }`. Outside that expected
struct-key position, brace syntax keeps its existing dictionary-literal
meaning. Semantic analysis requires every K field exactly once, rejects unknown
fields, and checks each value against the declared field type. LLVM constructs
the same concrete aggregate as an explicitly named struct literal before the
normal statically dispatched hash/equality lookup. Example 71 uses the concise
form for all lookups; diagnostics cover missing and unknown fields.

A typed dictionary literal establishes K and V once in its header. Every struct
key may therefore omit the repeated nominal name symmetrically:

```smalllang
{SymbolKey: Text;
  { scope: 1, id: 10 }: "lexer",
  { scope: 1, id: 20 }: "parser",
  { scope: 2, id: 10 }: "semantic"
}
```

This extends the existing typed-empty `{K: V}` form: the semicolon separates
the one-time type header from initialized entries. Unlike first-element-driven
inference, no entry is syntactically special and reordering entries cannot
change their interpretation. Each abbreviated key receives the same
field-completeness, unknown-field, and field-type checks as an abbreviated
lookup key.

The same expected K applies to mutation, so `symbols! -> put({ scope: 1,
id: 20 }, "syntax")` also omits the nominal key name. If V is a struct, the
value argument receives the corresponding contextual treatment as well.

## D086 - Standard Option And Result Specializations

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-12

`Option<T>` and `Result<T, E>` are compiler-known parametric tagged values that
reuse the ordinary enum ABI, exhaustive `when` analysis, typed payload binding,
and recursive static drop glue. Their source constructors and patterns keep the
specialization visible:

```smalllang
Option<Int>.Some(42)
Option<Int>.None
Result<Int, Text>.Ok(7)
Result<Int, Text>.Err("invalid")
```

This foundation provides explicit absence and typed success/error values
without nulls, exceptions, runtime type descriptors, or vtables. Example 72
verifies function contracts, exhaustive matching, both Result payloads, and an
owned `Option<OwnedNode>` payload. Concise propagation syntax remains a later
compiler-construction gate.

## D087 - Contextual Struct Elements In Typed Arrays

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-12

Typed initialized arrays declare their element type once before a semicolon:

```smalllang
[Point; { x: 1, y: 2 }, { x: 3, y: 4 }, { x: 5, y: 6 }]
```

The header supplies the expected type for every element, so a struct element
uses the same contextual brace form as typed dictionary keys. `[value; count]`
remains the repeat-array form; the typed initialized form is unambiguous when
its entries are struct literals. A trailing `~` keeps the existing growable
array meaning. Example 73 verifies the growable form, contextual `push`, and
iteration, with a diagnostic for a missing contextual field.

Growable typed arrays carry the same T into mutation calls, allowing
`points! -> push({ x: 7, y: 8 })`. Thus construction, indexing/iteration, and
mutation use one contextual-literal rule rather than separate conveniences.

## D088 - Fixed-Width Numeric Types And Stable Defaults

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-12

SL exposes numeric width directly when layout matters:

```smalllang
Int8  Int16  Int32  Int64
UInt8 UInt16 UInt32 UInt64
Float32 Float64
```

`Int` is exactly `Int32` on every target and `Float` is exactly `Float32`.
These are stable aliases, not platform-word types. This keeps ordinary source
concise, fits 32-bit microcontrollers naturally, and preserves deterministic
cross-target LLVM layouts. `UInt8` is
included because byte buffers, UTF-8 lexing, object data, and binary file I/O
need the full 0...255 domain.

`Long` is the concise `Int64` alias and `Double` is the concise `Float64` alias.
Code that wants the width visible at the use site can always spell the exact
fixed-width names. Pointer-sized indexing types (`Size` and `UIntSize`) remain a
separate target-ABI feature rather than making ordinary `Int` target-dependent.

Integer literals default to `Int`; fractional/exponent literals default to
`Float`. Conversions are explicit constructor-like expressions such as
`Int8(42)`, `UInt64(value)`, and `Float32(1.5)`. Literal conversions are checked
at compile time, runtime integer narrowing emits range checks, and mixed-width
arithmetic is rejected until the programmer chooses the intended conversion.
Arithmetic and comparisons lower to the concrete LLVM integer or IEEE-754
type. Example 74 covers scalar functions, structs, fixed arrays, signed and
unsigned full-width values, floating-point arithmetic, and conversions.

## D089 - Compile-Time Collection Expansion

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-12

An inclusive constant integer range can initialize an array directly:

```smalllang
[1..10]
[1..10 -> each { it + 1 }]
[1..3 -> each item { item * item }]
```

The parser evaluates the bounds and pure integer selector expressions and
rewrites them to ordinary array literal elements before semantic analysis and
LLVM emission. Dictionaries use the corresponding `key: value` selector:

```smalllang
{1..3 -> each { it: it * 10 }}
```

No runtime range or `each` loop remains in generated LLVM. The first slice is
deliberately strict: bounds and selector expressions must be compile-time
integer expressions, arithmetic is checked, descending ranges are rejected,
and one expansion is limited to 100,000 elements to bound compiler memory use.
Future constant evaluation may admit immutable constants and pure functions
without changing this collection syntax.

## D090 - Zero-Argument Functions Use Property Syntax

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-12

A function with no input is invoked by naming it:

```smalllang
nowMillis => arrayScanStart
getName => name
```

Empty parentheses are an error:

```smalllang
nowMillis() => arrayScanStart # Error
```

This rule applies to user functions, standard-library wrappers, runtime
intrinsics, imported functions, and zero-argument associated/method members.
Parentheses communicate that actual arguments follow. A fluent call still
receives its left-hand value, so `value -> transform()` remains compatibility
syntax for that one-input call; the preferred spelling is `value -> transform`.

## D091 - Struct-Scoped Nested Structs

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-12

A struct may declare a helper value type inside its body:

```smalllang
struct Lexer {
    struct Cursor {
        offset: Int
        line: Int
    }

    cursor: Cursor
}
```

The nested declaration has the collision-free nominal identity `Lexer.Cursor`,
while fields and `impl Lexer` bodies may use the short name `Cursor`. It is
private to `Lexer` by default, matching the intent that implementation helper
types should not expand the surrounding module API. Writing `public struct`
for the nested declaration explicitly exposes `Lexer.Cursor`.

Nested structs participate in the ordinary exact-layout, move, recursive drop,
cycle checking, field initialization, and LLVM lowering rules. They are not a
runtime object or namespace wrapper.

## D092 - Angle Brackets Separate Generics From Arrays

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-12

Type and compile-time value parameters use angle brackets:

```smalllang
Result<Int, Text>
Option<Int>
identity<T> value: T -> T => value
fixedLength<N: Int> values: [Int; N] -> Int { N }
values -> fixedLength<3>
```

Square brackets are reserved for arrays, indexing, fixed lengths, and
compile-time collection expansion. This removes the visual ambiguity between
`Result<T, E>` and an array expression. Unlike the earlier Mojo-inspired
surface, SL follows the familiar Rust/Swift/Kotlin type-application shape while
still allowing type and value parameters in the same compile-time list. The old
generic `[...]` spelling is removed rather than retained as compatibility
syntax.

## D093 - Typed Result Propagation With Postfix Question Mark

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-12

Postfix `?` unwraps `Result<T, E>.Ok` and immediately returns an `Err` from the
enclosing `Result<U, E>` function:

```smalllang
doubleChecked value: Int -> Result<Int, Text> {
    validate(value)? => checked
    Result<Int, Text>.Ok(checked * 2)
}
```

The operand must be `Result<T, E>`, the enclosing function must return a
`Result` with the exact same error type, and LLVM lowering emits an explicit tag
branch rather than exceptions or stack unwinding. The error branch drops live
owned locals before returning. Owned payloads are supported when `?` consumes a
fresh Result temporary or the enclosing function's explicit `move Result<T, E>`
input. Extraction transfers the active payload, removes the consumed Result
owner, and enum construction consumes a named owned payload so exactly one final
drop obligation remains. Applying `?` to a named non-move owned Result remains a
compile-time error.

## D094 - Target-ABI Size Integers

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-12

`Size` and `UIntSize` are distinct integer types whose representation follows
the target pointer width. `Size` is signed so pointer differences and relative
offsets can be negative; `UIntSize` is unsigned for allocation sizes,
capacities, and non-negative native counts. They are not aliases of `Int`:
`Int` remains the portable `Int32` default on x64 and wasm32.

The selected compilation target is passed into semantic analysis before type
layout is calculated. Consequently literal bounds, checked conversions,
struct/enum/container layout, function ABI, arithmetic, comparison, hashing,
and interpolation all agree on one width. LLVM lowers both types to `i64` on
Windows/Linux x64 and `i32` on wasm32 while retaining signedness in operations
and extensions. Example 79 verifies x64 execution and generated LLVM for both
widths.

## D095 - UTF-8 Text Iterates Unicode Code Points

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-12

SL distinguishes UTF-8 storage from decoded Unicode scalar values. The
`CodePoint` value type has an `i32` ABI on every target and excludes UTF-16
surrogates and values above `U+10FFFF`. `Text -> each scalar { ... }` decodes
one scalar per iteration and never exposes continuation bytes as characters.

This follows Rust's small compiler-friendly `char` model rather than making
Swift-style extended grapheme clusters the primitive. Grapheme segmentation is
important for user interfaces but requires Unicode property tables and is not
the right unit for tokenization. The generated decoder validates continuation
bytes, truncation, overlong encodings, surrogate values, and the Unicode upper
bound before the loop body runs. `CodePoint` conversion enforces the same value
invariant, and direct arithmetic is rejected so it cannot manufacture invalid
scalars. Example 80 covers ASCII, Hangul, a decomposed combining mark, and a
supplementary-plane emoji.

## D096 - Owned Offset-Based Byte Arena

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-12

SL provides `Arena` for compiler data whose allocations share one lifetime.
The owner stores a backing pointer, used byte count, and capacity, but safe
source code receives only stable `UIntSize` offsets. This preserves memory
safety across growth without exposing raw addresses or pretending that an
arena allocation has an independent destructor.

Allocation is a checked aligned pointer bump. A nonzero power-of-two alignment
is required; padding and end arithmetic trap on overflow. Capacity grows to at
least the larger of twice the old capacity and the required end, used bytes are
copied, and the old block is freed immediately. Checked byte load/store reject
offsets outside the initialized prefix. Reset retains the backing allocation
and rewinds the bump position. Moving an arena transfers its one drop
obligation; mutable borrowing updates the caller's three-word handle in place.

`box T` deliberately keeps its conventional meaning: it always creates one
individually owned heap allocation. Automatic stack/inline placement applies to
ordinary values and existing compiler-selected container backing storage, not
to an explicit `box`. Example 48 continues to assert heap allocation/free for
boxes, while example 81 verifies arena alignment, growth, stable offsets,
checked access, reset, mutable borrowing, move transfer, and final one-shot
release.

## D097 - Memory Mapping Is Native Syntax With Contextual Sizes

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-12

Large-file access uses `map read` and `map write` expressions rather than a
library object constructor. The result is an affine owned byte view, immutable
for read mappings and mutable for write mappings. Checked indexing exposes
`UInt8`, `len` exposes `UIntSize`, `each` streams over the view, `flush`
requests synchronous writeback, and scope exit unmaps exactly once.

Numeric literals use the meaning of their syntax position. `at` and `size`
infer `UInt64`, because file offsets and file lengths must remain portable even
on 32-bit targets. `for` and byte indices infer `UIntSize`, because they address
the current process view. Thus `at 4_000_000_000` is equivalent to
`at UInt64(4_000_000_000)` without requiring repetitive constructors; explicit
constructors remain accepted. Nonliteral expressions stay strictly typed so a
variable cannot silently change width.

Windows lowering uses file mappings and compensates for allocation granularity;
Linux lowering uses shared `mmap` views and page alignment. Handles/file
descriptors are closed after the view is established, while the mapped base and
aligned length are retained for flush/unmap. Example 82 verifies literal
inference beyond signed 32-bit range, mutable indexed syntax, read/write
lowering, iteration, writeback, and deterministic unmapping.

## D098 - Process Arguments Are A Read-Only Host View

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-12

SL exposes launch arguments as `sys.process.arguments: -> Arguments`. The type
is deliberately not an owned dynamic Text array: the host already owns the
Linux argument bytes, while the Windows runtime owns one conversion lifetime.
Treating either as an ordinary independently movable array would invent the
wrong ownership and mutation semantics. `Arguments` is therefore a copyable,
read-only, process-lifetime view with checked `UIntSize` indexing, `UIntSize`
`len`, and borrowed `Text` iteration.

Windows uses `CommandLineToArgvW`, so quoting and backslash behavior follows the
operating system instead of a hand-written partial parser. Each item is
converted with strict UTF-8 output, retained for the program lifetime, and
freed with the records table at exit. Linux accepts `argc` and `argv` in the
generated `main` ABI and measures each selected argument without copying.
Arguments can contain spaces and non-ASCII text on both targets. The first item
remains host-provided and is not a trusted canonical executable path.

The compiler detects whether the main AST reaches this intrinsic. Argument
helpers, Windows allocations, initialization, and teardown are omitted when it
does not, preserving stack-placement LLVM assertions and small programs. This
follows Rust's distinction between process-provided argument views and ordinary
owned collections, and Zig's explicit process initialization context. Example
83 and its argument fixture verify count, checked indexing, spaces, Hangul,
Windows execution, and Linux execution. Environment access and structured
child-process execution remain the next host-boundary slices.

## D099 - Environment Lookup Distinguishes Missing From Empty

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-12

`sys.process.environment: Text -> Option<Text>` returns `None` only when a name
is absent and `Some(text)` for every present value, including empty text. A
plain `Text` return with an empty fallback was rejected because it would erase
this distinction and force compiler/build logic to guess whether configuration
was intentionally empty.

The returned text is a process-lifetime borrow. Linux uses `getenv` storage,
which remains stable because safe SL exposes no environment mutation. Windows
converts the Unicode value to UTF-8 and records every successful conversion in
a runtime-owned linked allocation list. Program exit frees both the values and
tracking nodes exactly once. Missing, empty, non-ASCII, allocation failure, and
invalid embedded-zero names have distinct runtime paths; operational failures
trap and are never disguised as `None`.

Host runtime code is generated only when an environment intrinsic occurs in
main or a user function. Example 84 uses a per-example environment fixture and
verifies Hangul, a present empty value, and a missing value on Windows and
Linux. Browser wasm has a targeted unsupported diagnostic. This completes the
command-line/environment host-context gate; structured argv-based child
execution remains next.

## D100 - Generic File Output Is Constrained To Canonical Scalars

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-12

The Int-only bootstrap writer remains for the existing sorted Int64 examples,
but new code uses `sys.file.openWriter`, `write<T>`, and `closeWriter`.
`write<T>` is a true semantic specialization rather than an `Int` overload:
the inferred scalar type determines its LLVM storage type, alignment, and exact
byte count.

Supported specializations are `Bool`, `CodePoint`, every fixed-width numeric
type, and target-sized `Size`/`UIntSize`. Pointer-bearing or variable-length
types are rejected. This avoids the unsafe and unstable behavior of treating
all copyable values as raw bytes. The native targets currently serialize the
specialized scalar's canonical little-endian bit pattern. The legacy Int64
buffer is flushed before a generic scalar write, preserving call order.

Example 85 writes `UInt8`, `UInt16`, `UInt32`, and `Bool`, maps the resulting
file, and verifies all eight bytes on Windows and Linux. A diagnostic rejects
`Text`. User structs require an explicit serialization trait rather than
implicit ABI dumping.

## D101 - Zero-Input Generic Reads Use Explicit Type Application

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-12

`sys.file.read<T>` has no value argument from which to infer `T`, so callers use
`file.read<UInt16>` while retaining SmallLang's property syntax for zero-input
functions. `file.read<UInt16>()` is a compile error. Parser lookahead recognizes
the closed type application without consuming ordinary comparisons such as
`left < right`.

The result is `Result<Option<T>, Text>`: `Ok(None)` is clean EOF, while the
stable errors `"truncated"`, `"invalid"`, and `"io"` distinguish incomplete
scalars, invalid Bool/Unicode scalar encodings, and host failures. Native
Windows and Linux readers consume the exact scalar byte width sequentially.
Example 86 covers a value, Bool, EOF, truncation, and invalid Bool encoding;
diagnostics reject `Text` and empty parentheses.

## D102 - Child Execution Is Shell-Free And Argv-Structured

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-12

`sys.process.run` accepts `[Text; ~]` whose first element is the executable and
whose remaining elements are literal arguments. It returns
`Result<Int, Text>` with a normal exit code or stable `"spawn"`, `"wait"`, and
`"signal"` errors. A single command string was rejected because it conflates
program lookup, shell parsing, quoting, and user data, creating injection and
cross-platform incompatibility.

This follows Rust `Command`, Swift `Process`, and Mojo `Process.run`: configure
the executable and argv separately, then explicitly wait for status. Windows
uses strict UTF-8-to-UTF-16 conversion and complete Microsoft argv quoting,
including quote/backslash runs; Linux uses `posix_spawnp` and `waitpid` with
temporary zero-terminated storage. All temporary argv allocations are freed on
success and failure paths. Browser wasm has a targeted capability diagnostic.

Example 87 launches its own executable and verifies an argument containing a
space, Hangul, exit code zero, and a missing-program spawn error on Windows and
Linux. Two diagnostics cover the wasm boundary and non-Text argv. The complete
suite has 151 passing examples/diagnostics with zero build warnings/errors.

## D103 - Grammar Generation Produces Data, Not Parser Source Logic

Status: first bootstrap slice implemented
Date: 2026-07-12

SmallLang will not copy C# source generators or introduce a Rust-style macro
language merely to build its lexer and parser. The canonical lexer and EBNF
files compile into an ordinary `.sl` module containing declarative lexer
descriptors and a compact parser VM instruction stream. One reusable SL runtime
will interpret that data and build a lossless CST; ordinary SL functions will
lower the CST into the compiler AST.

`smalllang grammar build lexer grammar -o generated.sl` now parses grouping,
alternatives, `?`/`*`/`+`, keyword predicates, token lookahead, token/rule
references, and all current lexer pattern kinds. It emits 33 tokens, 75 rules,
lexer descriptors, keyword/literal pools, rule offsets, and a deterministic
1,508-word parser program. A source SHA-256 is recorded in the generated file.

The full runner regenerates the module and requires byte-identical output.
Example 88 compiles the generated module together with a separate root module
and accesses its public metadata, proving that the output is ordinary modular
SL source. This is deliberately not counted as a completed lexer/parser gate
until the SL VM produces token/CST snapshots equivalent to the bootstrap
compiler.

## D104 - Source Spans Use UTF-8 Byte Offsets

Status: first self-hosting substrate implemented
Date: 2026-07-12

Lexer, CST, diagnostic, and source-map locations share
`SourceSpan { fileId: Int, start: UIntSize, length: UIntSize }`. Stored offsets
count UTF-8 bytes rather than Unicode scalars, grapheme clusters, or rendered
columns. Bytes are stable under tokenization and map directly to source slices;
line, scalar-column, and display-column values can be derived for diagnostics.

`Text -> len` now returns its byte length. `byte(index)` exposes a checked
`UInt8`, while `slice(start, length)` returns a borrowed Text only when both
ends are valid UTF-8 boundaries. This gives the SL lexer efficient byte-level
classification without allowing invalid UTF-8 Text values. Example 89 verifies
ASCII byte access, a Hangul slice, byte count, and the reusable span method.
The bootstrap C# diagnostics have not yet migrated to this type, so the broader
source-span gate remains partial.

## D105 - Async Tasks Are Affine Structured Children

Status: first executable slice implemented
Date: 2026-07-13

Async syntax follows the existing left-to-right function and value-flow forms:
`Int -> async Int` declares the effect, an async call produces `Task<Int>`, and
`task -> await` consumes that task to produce its value. A temporary task can
also be consumed in the same flow as `6 -> square -> await => result`.
Parentheses and a second statement-shaped `await task` form are intentionally
unnecessary.

Task lifetime follows Swift and Kotlin structured concurrency: a child cannot
outlive its lexical owner. Scope cleanup therefore joins every unconsumed task
instead of silently detaching it. Task ownership follows Mojo's consume-once
coroutine direction: an explicit await removes the binding, so double-await and
use-after-await fail during semantic analysis. The surface keeps C#'s readable
`async`/`await` vocabulary while rejecting C#'s easy-to-ignore unobserved task
pattern. Rust's cold futures were not selected for ordinary calls because SL
uses a task-producing call to make parallel start order visible in straight-line
flow code. Naming two task-producing calls starts concurrent children;
immediately flowing a call into `await` expresses sequential suspension without
a disposable task name.

The initial Windows x64 lowering supports only CPU-pure zero/one-`Int` input and
`Int` result functions. Runtime and standard-library calls are rejected inside
this first slice rather than racing shared output or I/O state. Each call allocates one owned context and starts a native
thread; await or scope cleanup waits, closes the handle, and frees the context
exactly once. The self-hosted AST records async in function flag bit 8. Later
slices will generalize `Task<T>`, add Linux and stackless I/O lowering, then add
cooperative cancellation and task-group combinators without weakening the
structured lifetime rule.

## D106 - Consuming Calls Produce Region-Scoped Move Events

Status: first self-hosted cleanup slice implemented
Date: 2026-07-13

The self-hosted typed IR records a consuming call in a separate `MoveEvent`
side table instead of mutating value or type flags. Each event identifies the
call, the moved binding, and the nearest structured region. Function contracts
remain the source of truth: an argument is consuming only when the resolved
target parameter carries `move`.

LLVM cleanup suppresses an array or dictionary free only when the matching move
is after the binding, before the cleanup edge, and in that same region. A move
inside a nested conditional therefore cannot suppress cleanup on the parent's
sibling path. This follows rustc's separation of move analysis from drop
elaboration and Swift's declaration-level consuming contract without importing
Rust's complete place tree into the first slice. Recursive aggregate drop glue
is completed by D107, and field-level paths are added by D108.

## D107 - Struct Drop Glue Is A Static Obligation Tree

Status: first recursive self-hosted slice implemented
Date: 2026-07-13

An owned struct does not need a monolithic runtime destructor record. Its
self-hosted LLVM drop glue walks declaration metadata and expands only fields
that establish static drop obligations: dynamic arrays, dictionaries, and
nested structs containing either. Scalar fields produce no cleanup work.
Composite field types also participate in emitted LLVM struct layouts, so the
same type information drives ABI and destruction.

The implementation uses an explicit compiler work queue rather than recursive
inline SL calls. Each task carries a structural path encoded into deterministic
SSA names. This mirrors rustc's move-path/drop-obligation tree while fitting the
current bootstrap runtime, which intentionally rejects recursive inline local
functions. Normal function exit, early return, and consuming struct parameters
all use the same glue. A whole-owner move suppresses caller cleanup and the
callee recursively releases its fields exactly once.

Example 231 assembles, links, and executes LLVM for `Outer -> Inner -> [Int; ~]`
on normal, moved, and early-return paths. D108 adds the first field-path mask
over this obligation tree.

## D108 - Partial Moves Release One Static Drop Path

Status: first static self-hosted slice implemented
Date: 2026-07-13

A partial move is represented by the binding identity plus the complete member
path, not by invalidating the whole struct. Moving `outer.left.values` releases
only that leaf's drop obligation. Destruction still walks `outer`, expands
`left` and `right`, skips the exact moved leaf, and releases every owned sibling.
The extracted value becomes a separate owner and is dropped exactly once.

Typed IR stores the member node on each `MoveEvent`. Sequential member-type
resolution preserves every intermediate nominal type, and LLVM compares the
resolved field ordinals with its static drop-task ancestry. The ownership
diagnostic is deliberately a separate module from ordinary type checking: a
subsequent use of the whole owner, the moved path, a descendant, or an ancestor
is rejected, while a diverging sibling path remains valid.

Examples 232 and 233 verify nested extraction, sibling cleanup, LLVM assembly,
native execution, and invalid whole-owner reuse. This slice does not yet model
field reinitialization or control-flow joins with different moved-path sets;
those require dataflow state per region before the broader path-sensitive
ownership gate can be complete.

The emitter marks drop requests that can actually intersect a partial move.
D109 then hoists the immutable typed IR, move events, type tables, and module
identities into one emitter analysis context, so drop glue and local helpers no
longer rebuild the same metadata.

## D109 - Emitter Analysis Is An Owned, Borrowed Context

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-13

The self-hosted LLVM backend computes typed IR, move events, nominal types,
composite types, and module identities once. An owned `EmitContext` keeps those
arrays alive for the whole emission and local helpers borrow its fields. The
context is consumed once when emission finishes, preserving deterministic
cleanup without global mutable caches.

Constructing a context transfers each owned field from its source binding.
Reading `context.ir` or `context.sources` through a named owner is a borrow, not
an anonymous heap value, while moving such a field still participates in the
existing partial-move rules. Example 235 covers the multi-owned-field transfer
and a nested local helper borrowing the cached typed IR.

Example tests now bound every child process to five minutes, kill the complete
process tree on timeout, default to eight workers, and report per-case timing.
Compiler optimization can be selected with the conventional `-O0`, `-O1`,
`-O2`, and `-O3` flags; tests use `-O1`. The full suite shows that large
self-hosted LLVM cases remain dominated by native optimization, so module-level
object caching is the next performance step rather than further blind worker
growth.

## D110 - Task Result Types Are Generic But Task Ownership Is Affine

Status: first generic-result slice implemented
Date: 2026-07-13

An async declaration still exposes its ordinary result type, while a call
produces `Task<T>` and `await` consumes that task to recover `T`. This follows
Rust `Future::Output` and Kotlin `Deferred<T>` in preserving the result type,
and Swift/Kotlin structured concurrency in keeping child work inside its parent
scope. SmallLang deliberately differs from Kotlin's repeatable `Deferred.await`:
the task handle is an affine owner, so its native handle, context, and possibly
owned result have one statically provable cleanup path.

All specializations share `%smalllang.task = { ptr, ptr }`. The heap context is
specialized to the LLVM representation and alignment of `T`, avoiding boxed
`Any` values and runtime type tags. Awaiting transfers an owned result to the
caller. Dropping an unawaited task joins it, recursively drops its result, then
releases the context and OS handle. Unit, numeric, Bool, Text, dynamic collections,
and owned structs are executable in example 236. Example 237 records bit 8 on
self-hosted typed-IR call nodes while preserving the declared result metadata,
so later self-hosted async lowering can recover `T` without type erasure.

The current worker input remains absent or `Int`, and Windows native threads
remain the only executor. General inputs and captures require a compile-time
sendability gate; Linux and nonblocking I/O require the planned stackless
scheduler. Cancellation and dynamic task groups follow after those foundations.

## D111 - Async Inputs Use Structural Sendability And Ownership Transfer

Status: first general-input slice implemented
Date: 2026-07-13

Async inputs are no longer restricted to `Int`. SmallLang infers sendability
structurally instead of requiring a marker on ordinary value types. Numeric
values, `Bool`, immutable `Text`, and structs/enums composed only of sendable
values can be copied into a task context. A value that contains owned heap
storage must instead use a `move` input, such as
`process packet: move Packet -> async Result`. The task then owns the value and
must either move it into its result or drop it after the body. Mutable borrows,
borrowed slices/views, arenas, mappings, and tasks are not sendable in this
slice.

This combines Swift's inferred `Sendable` for value compositions with Rust's
automatically derived `Send`, while making the transfer rule more explicit for
SmallLang's affine owners. It also avoids Kotlin's shared-mutable-state hazards:
there is no shared mutable alias to synchronize because an owned value moves to
exactly one concurrency domain. No `unsafe Sendable` escape hatch is introduced;
future shared state must come through an explicit atomic, lock, actor, or isolated
runtime type with a compiler-known contract.

The heap worker context is specialized over both input and result LLVM layouts.
Owned input cleanup is emitted on normal worker completion and on native thread
creation failure. Example 238 covers scalar, Text, value struct, owned struct,
dynamic array, box, and recursive enum inputs, including move-through-result and
unawaited-task cleanup. Diagnostics reject owned default borrows, borrowed views,
and mutable borrows.

## D112 - Task Primitives Are Platform-Neutral Before Stackless Lowering

Status: Windows/Linux native-thread backends implemented
Date: 2026-07-13

User async lowering no longer calls `CreateThread`, `WaitForSingleObject`, or
`CloseHandle` directly. It targets the internal primitives
`smalllang_task_start`, `smalllang_task_join`, and `smalllang_task_release`.
Windows maps these to kernel thread handles. Linux allocates an owned x64
`pthread_t` cell, starts a worker with `pthread_create`, joins it with
`pthread_join`, and frees the cell on release. The public `%smalllang.task =
{ ptr, ptr }` representation and generic input/result context remain identical
on both targets.

Worker result ABIs stay platform-correct behind that boundary: Windows x64 uses
an `i32` thread result and Linux x64 uses the POSIX `ptr` result. Linux linking
uses `-pthread` during object generation and final WSL linking. Native execution
was verified for generic sendable inputs/results, nested await, and lexical
scope joining.

This is an executor boundary, not the final scheduler. The next lowering will
replace the blocking native-thread implementation behind the same semantic
surface with coroutine frames and resume continuations. LLVM's async-continuation
model likewise puts argument/result marshalling in an async context and requires
the frontend to describe suspension control flow. SmallLang will retain its
owned context and affine task cleanup while adding explicit state/resume/destroy
entries and an event loop.

## D113 - Owned Field Replacement Drops The Previous Value And Transfers The New Owner

Status: reference compiler implemented
Date: 2026-07-13

Assigning to an owned mutable struct field is an ownership transition, not a
bitwise overwrite. The compiler first evaluates the replacement, drops the
field's previous value, stores the replacement, and consumes every named owner
transferred into that replacement. A later use of a consumed replacement is a
compile-time error. Fresh container construction remains valid without an
intermediate owner.

Final struct cleanup always loads the current mutable aggregate rather than the
value captured when the binding was introduced. This prevents a replaced field
from being freed twice and ensures the replacement is freed exactly once.
Example 240 covers nested owned structs and dynamic arrays; its diagnostic
covers use after transfer. The self-hosted move-path checker still needs to
model field reinitialization and control-flow joins before this rule closes the
corresponding self-hosting gate.

## D114 - Async Tasks Use An Owned Cooperative Frame Before True Suspension

Status: cooperative executor and self-host suspension plan implemented
Date: 2026-07-14

SmallLang no longer creates one OS thread for every async call. Windows and
Linux share one `%smalllang.task_control` layout containing the specialized
context, resume and destroy entries, FIFO ready link, lifecycle status, and a
reserved resume state. Starting a task allocates that control record and queues
it. `await` pumps ready tasks until its affine target completes. Releasing a
completed task invokes its destroy entry, which owns context deallocation, and
then frees the control record. Reverse-order await and lexical cleanup therefore
retain deterministic one-owner destruction without `CreateThread` or pthread.

This follows Swift and Kotlin in keeping scheduling below structured source
syntax, Rust in treating async work as compiler-generated state, and LLVM in
separating ramp/resume/destroy responsibilities. SmallLang deliberately keeps
its existing hot child-task surface and explicit `await`; it does not expose
polling, wakers, continuations, or executor objects in ordinary language syntax.
The self-hosted `typedIr.suspensions` pass assigns stable one-based state numbers
to `await` paths inside async functions so the SL LLVM emitter can reproduce the
same frame plan.

This is the first stackless boundary, not completed suspension lowering. A
resume entry currently runs its CPU-pure function body once, and a nested await
can still consume native call stack while pumping its child. The next slice must
spill values live across each await into the owned frame, set the numbered
state, return to the scheduler, and resume through a state switch. Nonblocking
timer/file readiness, cooperative cancellation/failure, captures, and task
groups follow that foundation. Example 241 covers FIFO scheduling and reverse
await on Windows and Linux; example 242 covers the self-host state plan.

## D115 - Tail Await Is The First True Stackless Suspension Shape

Status: reference compiler implemented
Date: 2026-07-14

An async function whose body starts one child task and returns that task's
awaited result now lowers to a real two-state resume function. State zero starts
the child, stores its task handle and context in the parent's owned async frame,
sets resume state one, and returns `false` (pending) to the cooperative
scheduler. The scheduler appends the parent to the FIFO queue instead of marking
it complete. State one reloads the child task, joins and releases it, transfers
its typed result into the parent result slot, and returns `true` (complete).

The worker ABI is consequently target-neutral: every resume entry accepts its
task-control pointer and returns `i1`, where false means pending and true means
complete. This is the first path where SmallLang async execution actually
returns to the scheduler at an `await`; it neither blocks an OS thread nor keeps
the parent SmallLang function on the native call stack. Owned array results are
covered so suspension cannot accidentally duplicate or prematurely drop the
child owner. Examples 228 and 243 assert the generated state switch and pending
return; example 243 also executes on Windows and Linux.

This slice deliberately recognizes only the single-binding tail-await shape.
General awaits still need liveness analysis, typed frame slots for every value
live across suspension, one resume block per `typedIr.suspensions` state, and
cleanup edges for partially initialized frames. Cancellation, failure
propagation, task groups, timers, and nonblocking I/O remain later layers rather
than additional surface syntax.

## D116 - Async Frames Spill Typed Live Values Across Multiple Await States

Status: reference compiler and self-host plan implemented
Date: 2026-07-14

The semantic compiler now preserves each validated function's binding types for
backend planning. For every direct awaited-task binding in an async body, the
LLVM emitter finds immutable bindings defined before that await and referenced
after it. Only those live values receive frame slots; dead bindings are not
stored. Slots use the exact LLVM type, inline size, and runtime alignment rather
than an `Any` box or a fixed-size buffer. Numeric and Boolean values plus
structs/enums recursively composed from those value types are supported in this
slice.

One resume switch covers every recognized await in source order. State zero
runs the first segment; each suspension stores its live values and child task,
writes the next state, and returns pending. The corresponding resume state
reloads and frees the spill storage, consumes the child result, and continues
with the next segment. This permits ordinary expressions and branches after an
await and permits sequential state 0/1/2/... suspension without retaining a
native SmallLang call frame. Examples 244, 245, and 246 cover exact liveness,
multiple awaits, scalar-only struct layout, and post-resume branching on Windows
and Linux.

The self-hosted typed IR exports `CoroutineFrameSlot` and `frameSlots`. It pairs
each stable `CoroutineSuspendPoint` state with every earlier binding symbol
referenced later in the same async function, including its resolved type origin,
module, and symbol. Example 242 now proves two suspension states and the live
slot for each state. This is the metadata required for the self-host LLVM emitter
to reproduce the reference compiler's typed frame layout.

Await inside branch/loop regions and borrowed values still use the older
whole-body path. Those shapes require control-flow liveness and borrow-region
proofs. Cancellation must also destroy a pending spill frame before this
representation can support task cancellation safely.

## D117 - A Suspended Frame Temporarily Owns Every Spilled Owner

Status: reference compiler and self-host ownership metadata implemented
Date: 2026-07-14

An immutable or mutable heap owner that is live after a direct await can now
cross that suspension. The compiler materializes its exact aggregate into the
spill frame and removes the source local before ordinary scope cleanup runs.
That removal is an affine ownership transfer: while pending, the frame is the
only owner. Resume loads the aggregate, frees only the spill storage, and
reintroduces exactly one local owner. Mutable arrays, dictionaries, scalars, and
structs also receive fresh resume-stack mutation slots so changes after await
are observed by later suspension or final cleanup.

Async functions no longer stack-promote containers. A promoted buffer would
point into the native resume invocation that disappears when the worker returns
pending; forcing heap storage until coroutine-frame allocation elision exists
prevents that use-after-return class. The active resume state is sufficient as
the initialization discriminant for the current straight-line state machine:
all slots for a state are stored before that state becomes observable, and all
are transferred out together on resume. CFG joins and cancellation will require
finer per-slot initialization/drop flags and a destroy path for a still-pending
frame.

Owned drop glue is complete for nested dictionaries as well as dynamic arrays,
boxes, structs, and enums. Dictionary helpers recursively drop owned keys and
values before freeing their table. This fixes a latent undefined helper exposed
by spilling a structure containing a dictionary. Example 247 carries and drops
an owned array/dictionary/box structure, example 248 carries one array across
two states and transfers it as the task result, and example 249 mutates an array
both before and after suspension. Windows and Linux execute the same paths.

Self-host `CoroutineFrameSlot.flags` uses bit 0 for a mutable binding and bit 1
for an obviously heap-owning composite (`[T; ~]`, dictionary, or box). The
self-host plan therefore preserves both type identity and the initial cleanup
contract needed by its future LLVM destroy emitter.

## D118 - Live Child Tasks Are Affine Coroutine-Frame Owners

Status: reference compiler and self-host ownership metadata implemented
Date: 2026-07-14

Starting more than one async function does not implicitly await either child.
If one child remains live while another child is awaited, its `%smalllang.task`
pair of handle and context moves into the coroutine spill frame. Ordinary local
cleanup can no longer observe that Task while the parent is pending. Resume
extracts the same pair, reconstructs exactly one `RuntimeTask` owner with its
original input/result type metadata, frees only the spill allocation, and later
`await` consumes and releases the child exactly once.

Consumed affine bindings are absent from the semantic function's final binding
map. Coroutine planning therefore recovers the type of a live Task from its
async declaration expression when necessary; it must not mistake disappearance
from the final map for absence at an earlier suspension point. Mutable Task
slots remain forbidden because Task ownership moves rather than aliases.

Self-host `CoroutineFrameSlot.flags` now uses bit 2 for an affine Task in
addition to bit 0 for mutability and bit 1 for obvious heap ownership. Example
242 proves that metadata for two children started before the first suspension.
Example 250 proves the runtime path with two already-started children, three
resume states, `%smalllang.task` store/load, and deterministic result `102` on
Windows and Linux.

This is structured concurrency at the ownership boundary: every started child
is either explicitly awaited or deterministically consumed by scope cleanup.
Cancellation and task groups remain separate future work because they require
a destroy path for pending child and spill-frame owners.

## D119 - Cancellation Consumes A Task And Destroys Its Active State

Status: reference compiler runtime and self-host destroy plan implemented
Date: 2026-07-14

`task -> cancel` is the explicit cancellation surface. Like `await`, it is an
affine final flow target: it consumes the Task binding, takes no parentheses or
arguments, and cannot be repeated. Lexical cleanup still joins an unconsumed
Task. This keeps ordinary structured scopes completion-oriented while allowing
the owner to state that a result is no longer needed.

The cooperative task control now stores a function-specific cancel entry in
addition to context, resume, normal destroy, ready linkage, status, and resume
state. Cancellation of queued work unlinks it from the FIFO ready queue before
destroying it. Because the executor is single-threaded and cooperative, a
caller cannot concurrently observe another Task in the running state. A
completed Task can also be canceled; its initialized owned result is dropped
instead of transferred to a caller.

Every async declaration emits a matching cancel function. State zero drops an
owned move input that never began execution. A completed state drops an owned
result. Each suspended state recursively cancels the active child, destroys
initialized spill slots in reverse definition order, frees the spill storage,
then frees the async context. Task-valued spill slots recursively use the same
primitive. Invalid states trap rather than guessing which owners were
initialized.

The self-host typed IR exports `destroySlots`. For each suspension it places a
synthetic active-child Task first, followed by owned frame slots in deterministic
LIFO order; scalar-only liveness slots are excluded. Example 242 proves five
destroy entries across its two states. Example 251 executes cancellation before
initial execution, after completion with an owned result, and during suspension
with an active child, owned array, and second live Task. It then runs another
Task to prove the ready queue remains usable.

This combines LLVM's separate resume/destroy entries with Rust's destruction of
suspended state and Swift/Kotlin cooperative cancellation. SL deliberately uses
affine flow syntax instead of an exception as its first cancellation surface.
Cancellation observation inside long CPU loops, task groups, and cancellation
propagation from a canceled parent scope remain later slices.

## D120 - Branch-Nested Await Preserves Structured CFG

Status: reference compiler and self-host suspension discovery implemented
Date: 2026-07-14

An `await` binding inside an `if` or `when` arm is a first-class suspension
point. The async worker keeps the source CFG instead of flattening branches into
a linear replay list. Its entry switch targets a stable resume label embedded
in the selected arm. At that label the worker reloads a state-specific frame,
consumes the stored child Task, and continues through the original join.

The first CFG frame is intentionally path-specific. It contains only bindings
that are active at that suspension, so cancellation never guesses whether a
sibling-arm owner was initialized. Straight-line liveness remains minimal;
branch lowering conservatively spills active lexical bindings. At joins,
immutable representations use value phis while mutable scalars, structs, and
container owners use pointer phis over their reconstructed storage slots. This
preserves exactly one owner and makes both the initially selected path and a
resumed path dominate later code correctly.

The self-host grammar previously described braced `when` arms without consuming
their braces or inter-arm newlines. The generated parser VM therefore rejected
valid multi-line arms even though the reference parser accepted them. The
grammar now models `LeftBrace BlockBody RightBrace` and explicit inter-arm
newlines; regenerated tables let self-host typed IR discover nested branch
suspensions and assign states independently per function. Examples 252 and 253
cover runtime resumption/cancellation, mutable and owner joins, and self-host
state planning.

Await in a `while` body remains the next CFG slice. A loop back-edge can revisit
one suspension state many times, so loop-carried mutable slots require a
persistent frame representation or explicit back-edge phis rather than branch
frame reuse.

## D121 - Loop-Nested Await Reuses States Through Back-Edge Phis

Status: reference compiler and self-host suspension discovery implemented
Date: 2026-07-14

An await site is a stable state-machine location, not a dynamically unique
event. A `while` body may therefore suspend at the same site on every iteration.
The async worker entry switch resumes directly inside the structured loop body;
normal completion of that body flows through an explicit continue block and
back to the loop header.

Every binding visible before the loop receives a header phi. Immutable values
carry their materialized LLVM representation. Mutable scalars, structs, and
containers carry storage pointers, with container pointer/length/capacity slots
kept coherent as one mutable owner. The initial predecessor supplies the
pre-loop representation and the back-edge supplies the post-body
representation. This makes both the first iteration and every resumed iteration
dominate the condition, body, and eventual exit without replaying earlier work.

State-specific spill frames remain temporary: each pending child owns the live
values needed at that site, resume reconstructs exactly one local
representation, and cancellation destroys the active frame. A loop may contain
multiple await sites, keep another affine child Task live across one site, own a
dynamic container across the back-edge, or branch around suspension on selected
iterations. Examples 254 and 255 cover runtime repetition, cancellation,
loop-carried mutable/owned state, a skipped-await path, and the self-host state
and frame-slot plan.

Early `break` and `continue` edges are deliberately rejected in a suspending
loop until each edge transports initialized-owner flags. Silently routing those
edges through the ordinary back-edge could otherwise read an uninitialized
state-specific owner or duplicate cleanup.

## D122 - Suspending Loop Controls Carry Edge Scopes

Status: reference compiler and self-host loop-target metadata implemented
Date: 2026-07-14

`break`, `continue`, `condition -> if break`, and
`condition -> if continue` are valid after an `await` in a `while` body. A loop
control edge first drops owners created inside that body scope, then records the
surviving local representation and its LLVM predecessor label. It never routes
through ordinary fallthrough cleanup a second time.

All continue edges merge at the explicit continue block. Immutable values use
value phis; mutable scalar, struct, and container state uses storage-pointer
phis. The resulting representation supplies the loop-header back-edge. Break
edges merge with the header's condition-false edge at loop exit, so values
restored after suspension dominate code following either exit form.

The streaming LLVM emitter gives the continue block a statically false
preheader edge. This keeps the header's two-predecessor phi shape valid even
when every source path breaks during its first iteration; LLVM removes the dead
edge. A required outer owner must exist on every incoming edge. If one control
path consumes it while another preserves it, the compiler rejects inconsistent
ownership instead of inventing a runtime initialization flag.

Example 254 covers guarded continue, explicit break, body-local box cleanup,
mutable scalar and dynamic-owner transport, an all-break loop, an all-continue
loop, repeated suspension, and cancellation. Example 255 proves self-host typed
IR still links direct and guarded exits to their structured while. The negative
diagnostic proves path-dependent consumption of a loop-carried owner is
rejected.

## D123 - Expensive Tests Run First With Dynamic Load Balancing

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-14

The example runner no longer gives a statically partitioned, lexically ordered
array to its eight workers. Self-host LLVM cases take roughly a minute while
ordinary examples take fractions of a second; contiguous range partitioning
therefore left most workers idle near the end of a full run.

Known `selfhost-llvm-` cases are now ordered first and a load-balancing
partitioner hands out the next case whenever a worker becomes free. Artifact
paths remain isolated per example, bootstrap and grammar determinism still run
once, and no overlapping top-level runners are introduced.

On the same machine and adjacent compiler commits, the complete 343-case run
dropped from 793.8 seconds to 382.8 seconds, a 51.8% reduction, with all cases
passing. This fixes scheduling starvation. Reusing fingerprinted self-host
modules or native objects remains a separate future optimization.

## D124 - Bare Yield Is A Cancellation-Aware Scheduler Suspension

Status: reference compiler and self-host suspension metadata implemented
Date: 2026-07-14

Bare `yield` is valid only as a statement inside an async function. It is a real
stackless suspension point with no child Task: the worker spills every active
typed local not already resident in its function context, stores a stable state
number, returns pending, and is appended to the FIFO ready queue. Resume reloads
the exact state frame and continues after the statement.

If the Task owner cancels it while queued, the state-specific cancel entry does
not look for a child handle. It drops affine Task spills and other owned values
in reverse order, frees the frame and context, and removes the task control from
the queue. Long CPU loops are therefore cooperative and cancelable at explicit,
reviewable points rather than through hidden preemption.

The spelling intentionally follows SL's zero-input property rule: `yield`, not
`yield()`. It also reuses an existing word contextually. Bare `yield` suspends an
async Task, while `value -> yield` continues to transfer a value out of a block
function. `main` and synchronous functions have no resumable Task frame and
reject the bare form.

This combines Swift's explicit scheduler yield, Kotlin's cancellation-aware
yield, and Tokio's requeue-at-the-back behavior while preserving SL's affine
ownership and target-neutral single executor. Example 256 proves an infinite
CPU loop yields so a later gate Task can finish, then is canceled with a live
box and dynamic owner in its frame. It also covers loop, branch, straight-line,
post-await, and repeated yield. Example 257 proves self-host metadata assigns
one shared state sequence while distinguishing await and yield kinds. Example
258 covers a live owned input, normal resumption, and an input transferred to a
child before yielding; each cancellation state retains exactly one cleanup
obligation.

## D125 - Typed Duration Sleeps Park Tasks Outside The Ready Queue

Status: reference compiler, native runtime, and self-host planning implemented
Date: 2026-07-14

SL represents elapsed time with the public `sys.time.Duration` value type.
`milliseconds` and `seconds` are ordinary pure constructors, and
`sleep: Duration -> async Unit` returns an affine Task. The intended surface is
therefore `250 -> milliseconds -> sleep -> await`: the unit is visible,
the suspension is explicit, and cancellation uses the same Task ownership rule
as user async functions.

The executor has a deadline-ordered timer wait queue in addition to its FIFO
ready queue. A sleep worker that is not due marks its Task waiting and inserts
it by monotonic deadline instead of returning to the runnable tail. When no
work is ready, the executor waits until the nearest deadline and wakes all due
timers at the ready tail. This performs no busy polling and creates no OS thread
per timer. Non-positive durations are immediately ready. Cancellation can
unlink either a ready or timer-waiting Task and invokes exactly one context
destroy path.

An async parent awaiting a child is likewise removed from the ready queue. The
child stores its unique affine waiter and wakes that parent exactly once on
completion. Canceling the parked parent first detaches this wake edge, then
recursively cancels the stored child. This prevents a slow child timer from
making an unrelated fast Task wait behind a nested blocking join.

This adopts Swift's typed Duration and monotonic Clock separation, Kotlin's
nonblocking cancellable delay behavior, and Rust's rule that pending work must
register how it will become runnable again. Tokio's timer future additionally
confirms that dropping a sleep should require no resource-specific cleanup.
The SL timer node lives in the existing affine Task control, so cancellation is
an ordinary ownership operation rather than a separate timer handle protocol.

Example 259 covers ordered 1ms/25ms timers, a canceled 1-second waiter,
zero/negative immediate completion, and elapsed-time behavior. Example 260
proves self-host multi-file module/call resolution for `sys.time` and preserves
the await suspension state.

## D126 - Async Regular Files Use One Shared Operation Worker

Status: portable scalar-read runtime and self-host syntax implemented
Date: 2026-07-14

Regular files do not share the portable readiness semantics of sockets. Tokio
therefore runs ordinary file operations on its blocking pool, while Java's
`AsynchronousFileChannel` associates a file channel with a shared executor.
Windows offers overlapped file operations and Linux offers io_uring, but making
either one the language ABI would make Task semantics platform-dependent.

SL exposes the operation, not its backend:

```smalllang
file.readAsync<UInt16> => pending
pending -> await => result
```

`readAsync<T>: -> async Result<Option<T>, Text>` is monomorphized for the same
fixed-width scalar set as synchronous `read<T>`. Its EOF and error contract is
identical. The first portable backend has exactly one lazily-created native
file worker per process. Task submission transfers the request to a lock-free
MPSC stack with release/acquire publication; the worker reverses each batch to
preserve FIFO submission order, performs blocking regular-file calls away from
the cooperative executor, and publishes a completion batch. The executor
waits for either the nearest timer or file completion rather than polling.

Windows uses auto-reset Events and `WaitForSingleObject`. Linux uses a pthread,
two eventfds, and `poll`. This is one OS thread for the file subsystem, never
one thread per Task. A later backend may replace the worker with IOCP or
io_uring without changing SL syntax, Task semantics, or call-site ownership.

Cancellation marks a worker-owned request and returns after consuming the Task
handle. The completion drain, which owns the final reference, invokes cancel
destruction and frees control storage exactly once instead of re-enqueuing the
Task. Structured shutdown waits for outstanding requests, signals the worker,
joins it, and closes native events. A parent awaiting an async file child uses
the existing unique waiter edge.

The self-host grammar now models `Path<Type>` as
`TypeApplicationExpression`; module-call resolution recognizes it as a real
call, and coroutine discovery retains the following await. The parser's
expression entry point also accepts a complete expression immediately before
the synthetic End token, matching the reference parser.

The current `openReader` compatibility surface still owns one process-wide
cursor. General self-host compiler I/O still requires affine reader/writer
handles, explicit-offset operations like .NET `RandomAccess.ReadAsync` and
Java's position-based file channel, async open/write/flush/close, and native
completion backends where profitable.

Examples 261 and 262 cover Windows/Linux completion, timer coexistence, nested
parent await, EOF, ready-queue cancellation, graceful worker shutdown, imported
generic type application, and self-host suspension discovery.

## D127 - Files Are Affine Owners And Random Access Is Position-Based

Status: owned read handles and scalar offset reads implemented
Date: 2026-07-14

The process-wide compatibility cursor cannot support independent compiler
modules or concurrent parsing safely. New SL code therefore opens an affine
resource:

```smalllang
file.openRead(path) => opened
reader -> readAt<UInt16>(offset) => value
reader -> readAtAsync<UInt16>(offset) => pending
```

`File` has one close obligation, cannot be copied, and is closed by ordinary
scope cleanup. A read offset is `UInt64` and does not mutate file position.
This follows Rust `FileExt::read_at` and .NET `RandomAccess.ReadAsync`, both of
which separate position from the file object's sequential cursor.

An async operation must not borrow a File beyond its proven lifetime. Rather
than adding an unsafe implicit escape, the first backend duplicates the native
handle into the affine Task. Completion or cancellation closes that duplicate
exactly once; the original File remains independently usable and closes at its
own scope exit. Windows opens the handle for overlapped I/O and supplies the
64-bit offset through `OVERLAPPED`; Linux uses `pread`. Both still complete via
the shared operation worker, so Task scheduling remains target-neutral.

The reference parser now distinguishes a flow type argument from the existing
compile-time integer argument. The grammar accepts both `value -> fixed<4>` and
`reader -> readAt<UInt16>(offset)`. Self-host call resolution ignores identifiers
inside `<...>` and `(...)` when selecting a flow target, avoiding accidental
resolution to `UInt16` or an argument binding.

Example 263 covers synchronous and concurrent asynchronous offset reads,
automatic File cleanup, duplicated Task handles, and Windows/Linux parity.
Example 264 proves self-host generic flow-target resolution. Diagnostics reject
File copying, unsupported scalar types, and negative/non-UInt64 offsets.

## D128 - Random-Access Writers Are Separate Affine Capabilities

Status: owned scalar offset writes implemented
Date: 2026-07-14

Reading and writing are different capabilities in safe SL. `openWrite` returns
`Result<FileWriter, Text>` rather than a mode flag on `File`, so attempting a
read through a writer or a write through a reader fails during type checking.
The writer is affine and uses the same deterministic native-handle drop rule.

```smalllang
file.openWrite(path) => opened
writer -> writeAt(UInt16(513), 0) => inferred
writer -> writeAt<UInt16>(1027, 3) => contextual
```

`writeAt` infers `T` from the value by default. An explicit type argument is
also accepted so an otherwise default `Int` literal can be contextually encoded
as `UInt16`. The second argument is a `UInt64` byte offset. A scalar write is
all-or-error and returns `Result<Unit, Text>`; exposing short scalar writes
would add recovery complexity without helping compiler workloads.

Rust's `write_at` establishes cursor-independent offset semantics and its
`write_all_at` demonstrates why the high-level contract should retry or fail
instead of silently accepting a partial buffer. .NET `RandomAccess.WriteAsync`
likewise keeps the handle cursor unchanged and treats the offset as an explicit
operation input. SL's current synchronous backend uses overlapped `WriteFile`
on Windows and `pwrite` on Linux. Linux writers are deliberately opened without
`O_APPEND`, whose interaction with positional writes is non-portable.

Example 265 writes scalars out of order, closes the writer deterministically,
then reads them back through an affine `File`. Diagnostics reject writer copies,
unsupported `Text`, and negative offsets.

## D129 - Async Writes Own Their Bytes And Native Handle

Status: portable scalar async writes implemented
Date: 2026-07-14

`writeAtAsync<T>` follows the same position-based, all-or-error contract as
`writeAt<T>`, but returns `Task<Result<Unit, Text>>`. The Task copies the scalar
bytes at submission and owns a duplicated native writer handle plus the 64-bit
offset. It never borrows the caller's stack or the original `FileWriter`, so
completion order and lexical writer cleanup cannot create dangling storage.

This is the ownership shape demonstrated by `tokio-uring`: an in-flight
operation owns the resource and stable buffer until the kernel returns it. It
also preserves .NET `RandomAccess.WriteAsync` semantics: the explicit offset
does not mutate a shared cursor and cancellation belongs to the operation.

The portable backend reuses one shared file worker for both operation kinds.
Windows writes through overlapped `WriteFile`; Linux uses `pwrite`. Completion
converts a full write to `Ok(Unit)` and every partial or failed scalar write to
`Err("io")`. Cancellation consumes the affine Task and closes its duplicate
exactly once, whether the request is still queued or already worker-owned.

Example 266 covers inferred and explicitly contextual scalar writes, concurrent
submission, cancellation before execution, read-back, and Windows/Linux parity.
Example 267 proves self-host generic flow-call resolution and await suspension
discovery. A diagnostic rejects non-scalar `Text` payloads.

## D130 - File Durability Is Async Sync, Not Buffered Flush

Status: portable asynchronous durability barrier implemented
Date: 2026-07-14

SL random-access writers issue complete positional scalar writes and have no
hidden language-level output buffer. Calling the durability operation `flush`
would therefore imply state that does not exist. The public flow member is:

```smalllang
writer -> syncAsync => pending
pending -> await => result
```

`syncAsync: -> async Result<Unit, Text>` synchronizes file data and metadata to
the filesystem. This follows Tokio's `File.sync_all`, while retaining the
cancellation-aware Task shape of .NET `FileStream.FlushAsync`. Windows calls
`FlushFileBuffers`; Linux calls `fsync`. A platform failure becomes `Err("io")`.

The Task owns a duplicated writer handle and runs on the shared FIFO file
worker. Consequently a sync request submitted after write requests observes
those writes before reporting success. Cancellation consumes the Task and
closes its duplicate exactly once; an operation already owned by the worker may
finish, but its former waiter is never resumed.

SL does not add `closeAsync` merely to mirror object-oriented stream APIs.
Pending random-access Tasks never borrow the source handle, and lexical affine
drop closes that source immediately. An explicit asynchronous close becomes
necessary only if a future buffered writer owns unfinished internal work or if
observable close errors enter the language contract.

Example 268 covers two asynchronous writes, the durability barrier, queued
sync cancellation, read-back, and Windows/Linux execution. Example 269 proves
self-host flow-call resolution and await suspension discovery. A diagnostic
rejects arguments and type arguments.

## D131 - Async Open Owns Its Path And Transfers One Handle

Status: portable asynchronous read/write open implemented
Date: 2026-07-14

SL exposes asynchronous construction on the file module rather than on an
already-existing object:

```smalllang
file.openReadAsync(path) => opening
opening -> await => opened
```

`openReadAsync` returns `Task<Result<File, Text>>`; `openWriteAsync` returns
`Task<Result<FileWriter, Text>>`. The Task allocation contains both its result
storage and a byte-for-byte copy of the path, so the worker never borrows a
temporary Text. A successful await clears Task ownership and transfers exactly
one native handle into the affine Result. Failure transfers none. Cancellation
closes a handle if opening completed before the cancellation became visible,
then destroys the context exactly once.

This mirrors Tokio's portable contract: path and options are moved into
blocking filesystem work, while an io_uring backend may later replace the
implementation without changing source syntax. It also avoids pretending that
.NET's asynchronous `FileStream` flag makes constructor-time open asynchronous;
that flag governs I/O on the opened handle.

An owned anonymous enum subject is now dropped after `when` when every arm
returns a non-owning value. This makes `opening -> await -> when { ... }` both
concise and deterministic instead of leaking the matched File/FileWriter.
Move detection also follows an enum-match subject, preventing a consumed Task
from being awaited again at scope cleanup.

The bootstrap grammar recursively parses nested generic annotations, including
`Result<File, Text>` and nested array/dictionary components. Example 270 covers
success, missing-file failure, cancellation, handle transfer, and Windows/Linux
execution. Example 271 proves self-host imported-call and suspension discovery;
a diagnostic rejects non-Text paths.

## D132 - Projects Name One Root Without Repeating Source Paths

Status: root project manifest and source-free build implemented
Date: 2026-07-14

Small projects previously needed the root `.sl` path on every compiler
invocation, even though import discovery already knew the complete module graph.
The project boundary is now declared once in `smalllang.project`:

```smalllang
project {
    name: "compiler"
    root: "src/main.sl"
}
```

`smalllang build` searches the current directory and its ancestors. An explicit
`--project` accepts a manifest file or directory. The root is relative to the
manifest, must stay inside that directory, and must name an existing `.sl`
file. Unknown or duplicate fields are errors. With no `-o`, the compiler writes
`build/<name>` with the platform suffix. Existing target, optimization, LLVM,
and output flags remain command-line overrides.

Swift demonstrates the value of a source-language-shaped manifest whose root
object names products and targets. Zig demonstrates the eventual expressive
ceiling of an executable build-language DAG. SL takes the staged middle path:
the first manifest deliberately has a tiny deterministic data subset that the
self-host compiler can parse without executing arbitrary host code. Its syntax
already looks like SL, so a later compile-time `project` value can extend it
without replacing project files or introducing TOML/JSON as a second language.

Example 272 builds a two-file project through its manifest and recursive dotted
import on Windows and Linux. The runner also verifies unknown-field and
root-escape diagnostics. This promotes the explicit-root build gate from
partial to complete; package dependencies and module/interface caching remain.

## D133 - Package Visibility Follows Direct Product Dependencies

Status: deterministic local package graph implemented
Date: 2026-07-14

`smalllang.project` now separates selectable products from package dependencies
while keeping both as compact SL-shaped maps:

```smalllang
project {
    name: "tools"
    products: {
        compiler: "src/compiler.sl"
        formatter: "src/formatter.sl"
    }
    dependencies: {
        syntax: "../syntax"
    }
}
```

This takes Swift Package Manager's useful separation between products, targets,
and dependencies without copying its executable manifest API. It takes Cargo's
exact relative path-dependency rule: local dependency paths point to the actual
package directory rather than searching descendants. It takes Zig's root-module
and build-DAG direction, but keeps bootstrap graph evaluation deterministic and
non-executable until SL can host it itself.

A dependency key is deliberately both the project identity and first import
segment. The referenced manifest must have the same `name` and a same-named
product. Renaming and multiple versions are deferred because current semantic
nominal identity is module-qualified rather than package-id-qualified; accepting
aliases now would silently conflate packages. Each package sees only direct
dependencies, while each dependency resolves its own transitive declarations.
The loader sorts dependency names, rejects graph cycles and duplicate names at
different paths, rejects one source file claimed by different packages, and
selects exactly one root product before source discovery.

The next distribution layer needs package-id-qualified nominal identity,
version constraints, content-pinned remote sources, a checked-in lock file, and
workspace resolution. Those features must preserve deterministic inputs before
the build manifest becomes an executable compile-time SL value.

## D134 - Typed Roles Reuse Result-Producing Block Functions

Status: accepted; common foundation implemented, role libraries in progress
Date: 2026-07-14

Builders, scoped contexts, and handlers use one typed block-function mechanism:

```smalllang
source -> build item {
    # normal SmallLang statements
} => result
```

`build`, `with`, and `handle` are ordinary resolvable function names rather
than keywords. The block function's final expression produces `result`; its
`yield` operations execute the caller-provided Unit block with a typed item.
This preserves `TypeName { field: value }` exclusively as struct construction,
keeps block contents in the normal AST, and avoids a macro-only sublanguage or
context-sensitive parser.

The implementation and evidence checklist is maintained in
[`ROLE_BLOCKS.md`](ROLE_BLOCKS.md). A role is not reported complete until its
semantic, ownership, LLVM, self-host, and cross-target checklist entries pass.

## D135 - Enum Patterns Infer Their Type From The When Subject

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-14

An enum subject fixes the enum type for every pattern arm, so payload patterns
omit the redundant type qualification:

```smalllang
openedReader -> when {
    Ok(reader) {
        reader -> readAt<UInt16>(0)
    }
    Err(error) => error
}
```

This is contextual pattern lookup, not a global import of variant constructors.
`Ok(reader)` above resolves only against the known subject type, such as
`Result<file.File, Text>`. A missing variant is diagnosed against that enum, so
another enum's identically named variant cannot be selected accidentally.
Fully qualified patterns remain valid when explicitness is useful, and enum
construction remains qualified because a constructor has no subject from which
to infer its type. The same rule applies to user enums and permits forms such
as `Value(value)`, `Some(value)`, `Missing`, and `None`.

## D136 - Self-Hosted Role Calls Remain Ordinary Typed Calls

Status: implemented through self-host typed IR; full role contracts remain partial
Date: 2026-07-14

The self-host compiler assigns result-producing block-function calls a distinct
AST kind only so their caller body and trailing result binding remain
recoverable. Semantic resolution does not introduce a special `build`, `with`,
or `handle` namespace: AST kind 48 resolves its payload token through the same
ordinary function symbol table as direct and fluent calls.

When `source -> role item { ... } => result` has a result binding, the self-host
symbol table projects `result` as a normal lexical binding. Expression
inference gives the call the role function's return type and propagates that
type to later references. Flat typed IR emits an ordinary kind-6 call, a
kind-17 binding, and reconnects typed body operations beneath the call. This
keeps later LLVM lowering independent of surface sugar while retaining enough
structure for scoped cleanup and effect analysis.

Example 279 proves AST payloads, lexical binding, call resolution, result-type
propagation, and typed-IR parentage. This decision does not mark role semantics
complete: capability escape, ownership on every exit edge, generic block-item
specialization, and handled effect sets remain.

## D137 - Role Input Is Selected Before Its Lexical Caller Block

Status: first self-host block-input contract slice implemented
Date: 2026-07-14

For `source -> role item { ... } => result`, the role call itself is a lexical
scope. `item` is a synthetic typed parameter owned by that scope and is visible
only inside the caller block. `result` is an ordinary binding in the enclosing
scope. This prevents the item capability from becoming visible after the role
call before ownership and capture analysis even begins.

The self-host type checker derives the role argument only from inferred
expressions whose source span ends before the role target token. Expressions in
the caller block can therefore never be mistaken for `source`, even when they
are closer descendants in the flat AST. The same boundary is used by generic
call-result inference. A nominal or composite source mismatch uses the existing
call-argument diagnostic code 6. If the resolved target has no declared
`block` input, role syntax emits code 17 over the complete role call instead of
silently treating an ordinary function as a role.

Runtime calls such as `println` have no source-module symbol table and are
excluded from module-backed type checking. This is required for runtime effects
inside role bodies and removes the invalid `sources[-1]` lookup exposed by the
new success example.

Examples 279 and 280 are the executable evidence. This decision deliberately
does not claim full self-host role parity: generic block-item specialization,
capability escape checking, effect-set enforcement, all-exit cleanup, and LLVM
role lowering remain open in [`ROLE_BLOCKS.md`](ROLE_BLOCKS.md). The Release
solution build completed with zero warnings and errors, and the single
coordinated eight-worker runner passed grammar/table determinism plus all 393
examples in 369.3 seconds.

## D138 - An Import Defaults To Its Final Path Segment

Status: reference and self-host implementations aligned
Date: 2026-07-14

An import without `as` uses its last path identifier as the local alias:

```smalllang
import smalllang.compiler.lexer
```

This is exactly equivalent to `import smalllang.compiler.lexer as lexer`.
Explicit aliases remain available when the natural name is unsuitable, such as
`import smalllang.compiler.semantic.expression_types as expressionTypes`.
Default and explicit aliases occupy one namespace and therefore share the same
collision rule.

The reference parser already implemented this rule. The self-host module pass
now records the final `Path` identifier as `aliasToken` when no `as` clause is
present, so qualified lookup uses the same token-backed comparison without
allocating a string. Self-host module resolution reports status 3 for the later
of two equal aliases in one source. Examples 110 and 113 execute default alias
capture and qualified lookup; example 282 and the reference diagnostic
`import-default-alias-collision` cover collisions. Explicit `as` remains
continuously exercised by imports whose chosen camel-case name differs from
their snake-case module segment.

## D139 - Generic Role Items Are Fixed Outside-In

Status: first nominal and shallow-composite specialization implemented
Date: 2026-07-14

For a generic role call, SmallLang fixes type variables from the source before
checking the caller block. The block body cannot retroactively select a type:

```smalllang
visit<T> values: [T; ~] -> Int block item: T { ... }

[1, 2, ~] -> visit item {
    item + 1
}
```

Here `[Int; ~]` fixes `T = Int`; only then is `item + 1` checked. This keeps
inference deterministic and makes imported and local roles identical. It also
avoids introducing Kotlin-style postponed builder inference before SL needs it.
Kotlin itself uses builder inference only when regular inference cannot fix a
type and describes lambda types as postponed variables in that fallback. Rust
likewise infers one concrete closure parameter type from its use context.

The self-host fixed-point pass now substitutes a matching nominal generic,
extracts a matching array/box element or dictionary key/value generic from the
source expression, and reuses a source composite when input and item generic
shapes match. It also reconstructs a one-level composite item such as
`T -> [T; ~]`. The specialized item then feeds ordinary operator inference and
typed IR. Example 281 proves scalar, array-element, reconstructed-array,
imported-role, result, and body-operation propagation. Recursive term-arena
integration across every consumer remains explicit follow-up work rather than
being claimed complete.

## D140 - Long Test Runs Stream Counted Progress

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-14

The example runner must never remain visually silent while expensive self-host
LLVM tests run. Bootstrap build and grammar verification use explicit
`[bootstrap n/total]` phase messages. Test scheduling prints
`[start n/total] name`; completion prints `[n/total] PASS|FAIL name (seconds)`.
Progress records all use stdout and are flushed immediately. Detailed failure
diagnostics remain on stderr; using two streams for counters is forbidden
because a merged terminal can reorder otherwise correctly locked records.

Started and completed counts use separate atomic counters because up to eight
workers run concurrently. A lock keeps each progress record intact, while the
actual compiler/test work remains parallel. Completion reporting is in
`finally`, so every normal return path, including detailed failures, advances
the visible counter exactly once. Diagnostics continue after success examples
with the same total rather than restarting at zero. This preserves the single
coordinated top-level runner rule while making its internal progress observable.

Regression evidence on 2026-07-14: the Release solution build completed with
zero warnings and errors. The coordinated eight-worker runner passed
grammar/table determinism and all 396 cases in 390.6 seconds. A focused
parallel check also verified that both emitted start and completion counters
form the exact monotonic sequence `1..total`.

## D141 - Semantic Types Use Recursive Canonical Terms

Status: recursive arena and generic block specialization foundation implemented
Date: 2026-07-14

Syntax types and semantic types are distinct. The AST preserves exact spelling
and source locations, while semantic analysis lowers every nested type into a
flat, index-addressed `TypeTerm` arena. Each term has a kind and up to two child
indexes; structural canonicalization interns equivalent complete trees. This
follows rustc's separation between syntax-level HIR types and canonical
interned semantic `Ty` values, while retaining a representation SL can
bootstrap without recursive heap objects.

Substitution is bottom-up over the arena. Replacing `T` in
`Result<[T; ~], {Text: box T}>` rebuilds and interns every affected ancestor,
so no container-specific string replacement or fixed nesting limit is needed.
Example 283 executes this algorithm in SL. The older nominal/composite tables
remain temporarily for existing consumers; the arena is the migration target,
not a second permanent type system.

Block-function item declarations now accept a complete `TypeAnnotation` rather
than a nominal-only `TypeName`. The reference compiler retains a generic block
type template, fixes `T` from the ordinary source, recursively materializes the
concrete block type, validates the specialized function and caller, and records
the specialization for LLVM emission. Example 284 executes `T -> [T; ~]`; the
`generic-composite-role-yield-mismatch` diagnostic proves the `yield` body is
checked after specialization. The self-host fixed-point pass performs the same
one-level reconstruction today and will consume the recursive arena as the
remaining shallow expression-type representation is migrated.

This is a partial semantic-infrastructure advance and does not promote a
roadmap gate. Full completion still requires recursive type ids in expression
inference, type checking, typed IR, ownership/effects, and self-host LLVM
lowering.

Regression evidence on 2026-07-14: the Release solution build completed with
zero warnings and errors. The generic/block/grammar/type focused slice passed
75/75, and the single coordinated eight-worker runner passed byte-for-byte
grammar determinism plus all 399 cases in 389.8 seconds.

## D142 - Recursive Type IDs Are Global Expression Currency

Status: first expression boundary implemented
Date: 2026-07-14

Semantic type identity is global to a compilation, not local to a source file
or spelling. `type_ids.sl` lowers each source annotation through the recursive
term arena and interns the result by semantic identity. A locally spelled
`Point` and an imported `model.Point` therefore share the same nominal node and
the same complete `Result<[Point; ~], {Text: box Point}>` root. Local/imported
origin is provenance only and is deliberately excluded from nominal equality
once declaration module and symbol identity agree.

Builtin semantic types are seeded in the existing stable symbol order, so the
canonical ID of `Unit` through `Bool` is identical to the legacy builtin symbol
ID. `expression_type_ids.sl` is the migration bridge: builtin expressions map
directly, while annotation-backed name expressions and resolved call results
use the complete recursive annotation root. It copies the returned semantic
arena into its result because moving an owned array field directly between two
owned aggregate values would create ambiguous ownership at the current
bootstrap boundary.

Examples 285 and 286 prove cross-module canonical identity for recursive
annotations and expressions. This remains a partial migration: exact recursive
equality must next replace shallow comparisons in type checking, then flow
through generic specialization, typed IR, ownership/effects, and LLVM. The
roadmap count therefore remains 48.5/60 (80.8%).

Regression evidence on 2026-07-14: the Release solution build completed with
zero warnings and errors. The focused 285/286 slice passed 2/2, and the single
coordinated eight-worker runner passed all 401 cases in 376.7 seconds with
flushed `n/401` progress records.

## D143 - Concrete Recursive IDs Govern Return And Argument Equality

Status: concrete annotation boundary implemented
Date: 2026-07-14

The self-host type checker now compares canonical recursive IDs for concrete
annotation-backed return expressions and call arguments. Equality therefore
includes every nested array, dictionary, box, and nominal-application child;
matching only the outer `Result` and its first component is no longer enough.
Example 287 proves that a two-module call accepts
`Result<[model.Point; ~], {Text: box model.Point}>` and rejects the otherwise
shape-identical type whose deepest nominal is `model.Other`. The same complete
comparison rejects a mismatching function return.

Recursive checking augments rather than blindly replaces the established
checker. A node records whether its tree still contains a generic parameter.
Only fully concrete expected and actual trees use exact ID equality; generic
call results remain on the existing specialization path until call-site
substitution also produces a canonical ID. When the old checker already emits
a mismatch, its stable diagnostic metadata is retained. An exact recursive
match can suppress a shallow cross-module false positive, and an exact
mismatch is added only when no older diagnostic covers that call or function.

`expression_type_ids.sl` maps builtin literals directly from the AST instead
of invoking the complete legacy expression inference pass a second time. This
keeps the migration bridge linear in the input representation and avoids
duplicating the dominant semantic pass inside `type_check`.

This is still a partial migration and does not promote a roadmap gate. Generic
call-site substitution must produce canonical IDs, and typed IR,
ownership/effects, and LLVM must consume them before the shallow representation
can be removed.

Regression evidence on 2026-07-14: the Release solution build completed with
zero warnings and errors. The complete self-host type-check slice passed 45/45,
including the two-module recursive case, and the single coordinated
eight-worker runner passed all 402 cases in 378.5 seconds with flushed
`n/402` progress records.

## D144 - Recursive Generic Calls Specialize Canonical Type IDs

Status: call-site specialization and typed IR boundary implemented
Date: 2026-07-14

Generic call specialization now operates on complete canonical type trees.
The input template is structurally unified with the concrete argument, using
the declaring module and symbol as each type parameter's identity. Repeated
parameters must bind consistently, multiple parameters are independent, and
substitution rebuilds and interns every changed ancestor from the leaves to
the result root. A call such as
`Result<[T; ~], {Text: box T}> -> Result<[T; ~], {Text: box T}>` therefore
produces one concrete result ID without container-specific special cases.

The recursive expression pass now canonicalizes local and imported struct
literals plus dynamic-array, dictionary, and box literals. Type checking uses
the specialized input and result IDs, emits one argument diagnostic for an
inconsistent binding, and avoids a secondary return mismatch caused only by
the failed call. Qualified and role-call wrappers retain the same behavior.

`TypedIrNode.typeId` carries the canonical expression ID alongside the legacy
shallow fields during migration. Successful generic calls reach typed IR with
a fully concrete ID; a call whose substitution fails keeps `-1`. Example 288
proves deep repeated substitution, two-parameter swapping, literal-driven
array/dictionary/box specialization, one intentional mismatch, and five
concrete generic call IDs in typed IR across two modules.

This remains a partial migration and does not promote a roadmap gate. Fixed
array length identity, ownership/effect consumers, and self-host LLVM layout
and lowering still need to use canonical IDs before the shallow type fields
can be removed. The count remains 48.5/60 (80.8%).

Regression evidence on 2026-07-14: the Release solution build completed with
zero warnings and errors. The representative typed-IR/generic slice passed
9/9, and the coordinated eight-worker runner passed all 403 cases in 411.8
seconds with flushed `n/403` progress records.

## D145 - Ownership Traits Fold Over Canonical Recursive Types

Status: move and coroutine-frame ownership boundary implemented
Date: 2026-07-14

Ownership classification is now derived from the canonical semantic type
arena instead of recognizing only shallow numeric origins. Each type receives
two independent traits: bit 0 means the value carries destruction
responsibility, and bit 1 means that responsibility reaches heap-backed
storage. Dynamic arrays, dictionaries, and boxes set both bits directly.
Fixed arrays and nominal applications such as `Option<T>` and `Result<T, E>`
fold both traits from their canonical child IDs. A local or imported nominal
declaration remains conservatively owned.

`TypedIrNode` carries these traits as `typeFlags` beside `typeId`. Exact
expression matches, binding operands, and resolved member field annotations
propagate the same canonical identity and traits. Typed IR can also materialize
an expression known only to the recursive pass when the temporary legacy
inference table has no entry. The recursive lookup is deliberately skipped
when legacy inference already has the expression; the final canonical mapping
then fills its ID once, avoiding an unnecessary all-expression scan for every
AST node.

Partial-member move discovery now tests canonical ownership rather than the
old array/dictionary/struct origin list. Coroutine frame planning uses heap
reachability, and `CoroutineFrameSlot` retains both canonical `typeId` and
`typeFlags` for later destruction and LLVM lowering. Example 289 proves that
`Result<[Int; ~], Text>` specialized through an imported generic call is
classified as owned and heap-reaching at the call, its binding, and the live
slot that crosses `await`.

This remains a partial migration and does not promote a roadmap gate. A
nominal node does not yet contain its declaration-field type edges, so heap
reachability through arbitrary nested struct fields is still supplied by the
older struct analysis. Capability escape and effect-set enforcement remain
separate work, and self-host LLVM still selects layout and drop glue from
shallow fields. The count remains 48.5/60 (80.8%).

Regression evidence on 2026-07-14: the Release solution build completed with
zero warnings and errors. The representative typed-IR/move/async slice passed
13/13. After eliminating redundant recursive lookups, the coordinated
eight-worker runner passed all 404 cases in 429.8 seconds with flushed
`n/404` progress records.

## D146 - Nominal Field Graphs Join Canonical Type Identity

Status: nominal ownership graph and first LLVM consumer implemented
Date: 2026-07-14

The canonical type context now records each nominal declaration field as an
edge from owner type ID to field type ID. An edge also retains declaration
module, owner and field symbols, source-order ordinal, and resolution status.
The field type comes directly from the source's completed `TypeTerm -> typeId`
map, so graph construction does not re-resolve syntax or search the global
reference table.

Ownership classification is a monotone fixed point over both ordinary type
children and nominal field edges. Heap reachability can therefore flow from a
dynamic array through `Result<[Int; ~], Text>` and then through an enclosing
`Envelope` struct. Applications that refer back to a nominal type are updated
on later iterations without depending on declaration order. Example 290
proves the field edge and follows the resulting owned/heap traits through an
imported generic call, its binding, and an `await`-crossing coroutine slot.

`TypedIrNode.typeKind` carries the canonical arena kind beside `typeId` and
`typeFlags`; bindings, member fields, and coroutine slots preserve it. LLVM
type selection now follows canonical kind and ownership whenever `typeId` is
available. Only not-yet-migrated nodes use the explicit shallow compatibility
branch. The central edge-cleanup selector likewise prefers canonical array,
dictionary, nominal, and owned facts. Example 291 deliberately corrupts the
legacy origin and scalar symbol while retaining the canonical fields, then
proves LLVM still selects `%sl.array.i32` and the correct struct type.

The first field-graph implementation searched all global references once per
field and made the 406-case run take 599.9 seconds. Reusing each source's local
completed term map reduced the final run to 495.9 seconds; the representative
LLVM dynamic-array case took 83.7 seconds alone. A reusable whole-compilation
analysis context is still needed to remove repeated semantic passes across
typed IR and LLVM rather than optimizing individual scans indefinitely.

This remains a partial migration and does not promote a roadmap gate. LLVM
storage size/alignment, aggregate layouts, recursive drop-glue tasks, and
generic nominal-application lowering still use shallow fields in substantial
paths. Those consumers must use the canonical type and field graph before the
compatibility fields can be removed. The count remains 48.5/60 (80.8%).

Regression evidence on 2026-07-14: the Release solution build completed with
zero warnings and errors. The recursive-type/ownership/LLVM focused slice
passed 11/11. The optimized coordinated eight-worker runner passed all 406
cases in 495.9 seconds with flushed `n/406` progress records.

## D147 - LLVM Storage Layout Uses Canonical Field Graphs

Status: target-aware storage layout and aggregate type declarations implemented
Date: 2026-07-14

Canonical semantic types now retain a parsed fixed-array `length` in addition
to the spelling hash used for identity. Numeric lengths therefore drive LLVM
storage size while value-generic length identifiers remain unresolved until
specialization. Every struct declaration that has fields also seeds its own
canonical nominal node before later modules are visited. A declaration no
longer loses its owner-to-field edges merely because its first type reference
appears in a later file.

`llvm.text.layoutsFor` computes size, ABI alignment, and status arrays over the
canonical arena. Builtin integers and floats use their declared widths;
`Size` and `UIntSize`, pointers, slices, dynamic arrays, dictionaries, boxes,
and text use the selected target pointer width. Fixed arrays multiply the
canonical element layout by the concrete length. Nominal struct layout is a
monotone fixed point over field edges, applies alignment padding at every
field and tail, and leaves unsupported generic applications or unresolved
recursive inline values explicitly non-layoutable.

The LLVM emitter prepares these facts once for the selected Windows x64,
Linux x64, or wasm32 descriptor. Mutable loads, stores, and allocas obtain
alignment from canonical type IDs. Named struct declarations are emitted from
canonical nominal nodes and field edges rather than rescanning source symbols,
nominal annotations, and composite annotations. The iterative type writer
also handles nested fixed arrays without relying on recursive inline SL
functions, which the current runtime intentionally rejects.

Example 292 proves a fixed `[Int16; 3]` layout of size 6/alignment 2 and a
field-graph struct whose dynamic-array descriptor produces different correct
x64 and wasm32 padded sizes. The example constructs the fixed type directly
because self-host AST lowering of fixed-array annotations remains a separate
open parser slice; host value-generic fixed arrays remain covered by examples
50, 51, 57, and 58.

This is still a partial migration and does not promote a roadmap gate. Dynamic
array and dictionary element allocation/index paths still carry shallow scalar
component symbols, recursive drop glue still reconstructs fields from source,
and generic nominal applications do not yet have concrete enum/variant layout.
LLVM preparation also repeats semantic resolution after typed IR lowering;
the next performance slice should return one reusable whole-compilation
analysis context. The count remains 48.5/60 (80.8%).

Regression evidence on 2026-07-14: the Release solution build completed with
zero warnings and errors. The LLVM/type-layout focused slices passed 7/7 and
13/13 with counted progress output. The collision-free coordinated runner
passed 405/407 cases in 416.7 seconds; its only two mismatches were the intended
struct and dynamic-array slot alignment changes from 4 to 8. After updating
those exact LLVM baselines, examples 231 and 232 passed 2/2, providing complete
evidence for all 407 current cases without rerunning the unchanged 405 cases.

## D148 - Prepared Semantic Context Removes Repeated LLVM Analysis

Status: canonical type and shallow declaration context reuse implemented
Date: 2026-07-14

Expression type-ID resolution and typed-IR lowering now expose prepared entry
points. `ExpressionTypeIdRequest` accepts an already resolved canonical type,
reference, and field arena. `TypedIrRequest` adds the nominal, composite, and
module tables needed by typed IR. The original `resolve` and `lower` APIs remain
compatible wrappers that prepare these inputs once, so existing clients keep
their surface while orchestration layers can reuse analysis products.

LLVM preparation is the first orchestration consumer. It resolves canonical
types, nominal annotations, composite annotations, and module identities once,
copies their flat relocatable records into the typed-IR request and emitter
context, and calls `lowerPrepared`. It no longer invokes `typeIds.resolve`,
`nominalTypes.resolve`, `compositeTypes.resolve`, or `modules.identities` again
after typed IR has independently performed the same work. The arrays are copied
because the current affine container model cannot yet move one owned field out
of a returned aggregate; semantic passes themselves are not repeated.

Example 293 constructs the prepared request explicitly and proves that its 11
typed-IR nodes have the same kind, canonical type ID, kind, and ownership flags
as the compatible `typedIr.lower` path; eight nodes carry canonical IDs. The
representative LLVM dynamic-array example 188 fell from the prior 83.7-second
single-worker baseline to 63.8 seconds, a 23.8 percent reduction. Sharing the
additional nominal/composite/module tables preserved the result at 64.0 seconds;
those tables are not the remaining dominant cost.

This remains a partial migration and does not promote a roadmap gate. Calls,
qualified resolution, AST/lexer/symbol products, shallow expression inference,
and several ownership/drop consumers still recompute their own tables. A future
whole-compilation context should cache those immutable products per source and
pass one package-qualified context through checking, typed IR, effects, layout,
drop glue, and code emission. The count remains 48.5/60 (80.8%).

Regression evidence on 2026-07-14: the Release solution build completed with
zero warnings and errors. The prepared/baseline typed-IR slice passed 13/13,
example 293 passed independently, and example 188 passed in 63.8 seconds. The
single coordinated eight-worker runner then passed all 408 cases in 396.5
seconds with flushed `n/408` progress records. Compared with the preceding
collision-free 416.7-second 407-case run, total wall time fell by 20.2 seconds
despite adding one case.

## D149 - Prepared Resolution Products Flow Through Typed IR

Status: module-call and qualified-resolution reuse implemented
Date: 2026-07-14

The prepared semantic boundary now includes module-qualified names and resolved
calls. `ModuleCallRequest` accepts existing module identities and qualified
results, `ExpressionTypeRequest` accepts nominal, composite, module, qualified,
and call tables, and `ExpressionTypeIdRequest` consumes the same package-level
products. `TypedIrRequest` carries all of them. The LLVM orchestrator computes
qualified resolution and module calls once and supplies those immutable flat
records to shallow inference, recursive expression IDs, and typed IR instead
of allowing every layer to resolve them again. Compatible `resolve`, `infer`,
and `lower` wrappers still construct the complete request for direct clients.

Source-local preparation also gained two lower-level boundaries.
`symbols.collectPrepared` builds a symbol table from an existing AST, and all
semantic passes that already own AST nodes use it instead of parsing the same
source again. `resolution.resolvePrepared` accepts existing AST, token, and
symbol products; its compatible wrapper preserves the old source-only API.
The latter is the contract for the next package cache, while broad consumers
still need to retain or copy those owned arrays before they can use it.

Example 293 now explicitly prepares qualified and call products and still
proves byte-for-byte semantic equivalence at the typed-IR boundary. The
single-worker LLVM example 188 improved from 63.8 to 58.6 seconds, another
8.2 percent reduction and 30.0 percent below the earlier 83.7-second baseline.
The coordinated eight-worker full run remained effectively flat at 397.9
seconds versus 396.5 seconds because eight simultaneous self-host LLVM cases
are dominated by shared CPU and linker contention rather than this serial
semantic slice.

This remains a partial migration and does not promote a roadmap gate. A true
package analysis context must own flattened per-source AST, token, symbol, and
resolved-name ranges so consumers can borrow them without repeated copying.
Type checking, ownership/effects, drop glue, and several LLVM source scans must
then consume that context. The count remains 48.5/60 (80.8%).

Regression evidence on 2026-07-14: the Release solution build completed with
zero warnings and errors. The recursive type/ownership/layout prepared slice
passed 7/7, example 188 passed in 58.6 seconds, and the single coordinated
eight-worker runner passed all 408 cases in 397.9 seconds with monotonic
`n/408` progress records.

## D150 - Whole-Compilation Facts Use One Borrowed Flat Context

Status: package context connected through checking, typed IR, and LLVM
Date: 2026-07-14

`smalllang.compiler.semantic.analysis` now builds one relocatable package
front end. `PackageAnalysis` owns flat source, AST, token, symbol, and resolved
name arrays. Each `SourceAnalysisRange` maps a source-local index space onto
those arrays. AST parent indexes, symbol indexes, and resolved-name indexes
therefore stay local and stable; consumers add the source range start only at
the package boundary. This avoids nested owned arrays and remains suitable for
serialization, memory mapping, and later incremental invalidation.

`smalllang.compiler.semantic.context.CompilationContext` combines those source
products with canonical types/references/fields, nominal and composite facts,
module identities, qualified names, and resolved calls. `inferContext`,
`resolveContext`, and `lowerContext` borrow that one aggregate. Type checking
and LLVM orchestration prepare it once and pass it through shallow expression
inference, recursive expression IDs, and typed IR. These hot paths index the
flat products directly rather than copying per-source AST/token/symbol arrays.
The older source-only and explicit request APIs remain compatibility wrappers.

Module identity, import, qualified-name, and call resolution also expose
`*Analyzed` entry points over the same package products. The context builder
uses them, so these passes no longer re-lex or re-parse merely to inspect module
paths and call names. Example 294 proves two source ranges are contiguous for
all four flat product tables, retain source-local root indexes, and account for
every stored record. Example 293 proves legacy prepared, source-only, and
borrowed-context typed IR remain equivalent.

The first owned-request version copied the package arrays into every semantic
request and raised example 188 to 65.1 seconds. It was rejected and replaced
before this decision was finalized. The borrowed context plus direct flat
indexing measures 63.5-64.1 seconds on the same single-worker example, close to
the earlier stable 63.8-second measurement but above the one-off 58.6-second
low. The two 409-case coordinated runs took 415.5 and 421.2 seconds versus
397.9 seconds for 408 cases. This is not claimed as a performance win: canonical type,
nominal, composite, and type-use resolvers still build their own source-local
products, so the context currently adds one package preparation before those
remaining migrations remove the older work.

The first analyzed module APIs duplicated their compatibility implementations,
which made every self-host manifest compile both paths. The final source keeps
one analyzed implementation and turns the original module/import/qualified
entry points into short wrappers. This removes that source duplication; a
focused post-refactor module/checking/IR/LLVM slice passed, while another full
run was avoided because the preceding two had already established the 409-case
behavior and the wrapper refactor did not alter the analyzed core.

This slice does not promote a formal gate. The next performance step is to make
canonical type terms/IDs, nominal types, composite types, and imported type
resolution consume `PackageAnalysis`; only then should package-context speed be
judged. Ownership/effect products, recursive drop glue, and remaining LLVM
source scans must join the same context afterward. The count remains 48.5/60
(80.8%).

Regression evidence on 2026-07-14: the Release solution build completed with
zero warnings and errors. Representative module, type-check, expression-ID,
typed-IR, LLVM, and context slices passed. Two coordinated eight-worker runs
passed all 409 cases in 415.5 and 421.2 seconds with monotonic `n/409` records;
the final compatibility-wrapper deduplication then passed its focused 7/7
slice.

## D151 - Canonical Type Preparation Joins Package Analysis

Status: recursive terms, canonical uses, and type resolvers share package facts
Date: 2026-07-14

`PackageAnalysis` now also owns flat recursive type-term and canonical type-use
arrays. `SourceAnalysisRange` adds contiguous `termStart`/`termCount` and
`typeStart`/`typeCount` pairs while preserving the source-local AST, token,
symbol, child-term, and canonical-use indexes stored in each record. Example
294 verifies both new ranges begin at zero for the first source, join exactly
at the second source, and account for every stored record.

The type-term and type-use lowerers expose prepared syntax entry points. Package
analysis parses and lexes each source once, then supplies the already built AST
and token tables to both lowerers. Canonical type-ID resolution consumes package
module identities, qualified names, AST, tokens, symbols, and term ranges.
Imported-type, nominal-type, and composite-type resolution consume the same
qualified results, nodes, tokens, symbols, and canonical type-use ranges.
Their original source-only entry points now create one package and delegate to
the analyzed implementation, preserving compatibility without retaining a
second resolver body.

The current affine aggregate model still requires one transient copy of each
source's AST and token records into the shared prepared-syntax request while
`PackageAnalysis` is being assembled. This replaces repeated parsing and
lexing, but it is not yet a zero-copy construction path. A future borrowed-view
or builder representation can remove that construction copy without changing
consumer APIs.

This slice does not promote a formal roadmap gate. Ownership/effect products,
recursive drop glue, and remaining LLVM source scans must still consume the
same context; dynamic-array/dictionary child lowering and generic nominal
application layout also remain open. The canonical count stays 42 complete,
13 partial, and 5 missing: 48.5/60 (80.8%).

Regression evidence on 2026-07-14: direct type-term/type-use tests passed 3/3;
the module/imported/nominal/composite/type-ID/context slice passed 8/8; Release
build completed with zero warnings and errors; and the single coordinated
eight-worker full runner passed 409/409 in 417.7 seconds with monotonic flushed
progress records. Example 188 passed alone in 65.08 seconds. These measurements
sit within the preceding context range (415.5-421.2 seconds full and roughly
63.5-64.1 seconds single), so the change is recorded as architectural reuse,
not a demonstrated performance improvement.

## D152 - Diagnostics, Coroutines, and Drop Glue Share Analysis

Status: ownership/type diagnostics and coroutine/drop consumers connected
Date: 2026-07-14

Type diagnostics no longer call nominal and composite source-only resolvers
independently or lower the AST again for spans. `analyzeContext` reads the
already resolved nominal/composite tables and flat AST ranges from one
`CompilationContext`. Partial-move ownership diagnostics similarly call
`typedIr.lowerContext` once and compare member paths against the context's
source-local AST/token ranges rather than parsing and lexing for each move.
Their source-only `analyze` entry points remain thin compatible wrappers.

Coroutine analysis now has one aggregate boundary. `CoroutinePlan` contains
typed IR, suspension points, live frame slots, and deterministic destruction
slots. `coroutinePlanContext` lowers typed IR once and derives all three side
tables from the same flat AST/token products. The legacy `suspensions`,
`frameSlots`, and `destroySlots` functions copy the corresponding table from a
single plan for compatibility. Example 242 uses the aggregate directly, so its
three requested tables no longer trigger six typed-IR lowerings.

LLVM `EmitContext` now retains the package ranges, AST, token, and symbol tables
needed after semantic preparation. Recursive struct drop and partial-member
move filtering use these records directly. They no longer call AST lowering,
lexing, or symbol collection while walking recursive drop tasks. The remaining
emitter still contains other source scans; those are an explicit next migration
target rather than being hidden by this decision.

Example 295 prepares one context and passes it to type diagnostics, ownership
diagnostics, and coroutine planning. Its executable result proves zero type
errors, one overlapping partial-move error, two suspension points, six live
frame slots, and five destruction entries from the shared products. Existing
diagnostic and async compatibility paths remain covered independently.

This migration does not promote a formal language gate. It changes reuse and
orchestration, not the completeness of effect enforcement, all-exit cleanup,
generic nominal layout, or canonical container-child lowering. Progress stays
42 complete, 13 partial, 5 missing: 48.5/60 (80.8%).

Regression evidence on 2026-07-14: type/ownership diagnostic tests passed 6/6,
the async/ownership/context slice passed 12/12, recursive and partial-move LLVM
drop tests passed 6/6, and example 295 passed independently. Release build had
zero warnings and errors. The coordinated eight-worker full suite passed all
410 cases in 388.7 seconds with monotonic flushed `n/410` progress. This is
29.0 seconds, or 6.9 percent, below the preceding 417.7-second 409-case run
despite one added case; it is recorded as an observed full-run improvement,
not as proof of an isolated consumer microbenchmark.

## D153 - LLVM Emission Uses Flat Package Syntax Products

Status: direct emitter AST, token, and symbol rebuilding removed
Date: 2026-07-14

`smalllang.compiler.llvm.text` no longer calls `lexer.lex`, `ast.lower`, or
`symbols.collect` while emitting a prepared package. Its 67 direct source
reanalysis sites now translate each typed-IR node's source-local indexes through
`SourceAnalysisRange` and read the flat `EmitContext` AST, token, and symbol
tables. Small helpers cover typed-IR payload tokens and AST starts; member-field
and interpolation-name searches use the declaring source's explicit token and
symbol ranges so imported layouts retain source-local identity.

This migration covers function and `main` scheduling, mutable-read/effect
ordering, region and return cleanup, literal and container operands, nested
conditionals, calls, member projections, interpolation value lookup, and
recursive partial-move comparisons. Source bytes remain intentionally present:
token spans point into the original UTF-8 source and LLVM literal emission must
still read those bytes. At this decision's boundary `ir.interpolation.lower`
still built its own source-level syntax products; D154 removes that remaining
indirect repetition.

No formal language gate is promoted. This is an analysis-reuse boundary, not
completion of capability/effect enforcement, canonical container-child
lowering, generic nominal-application layout, or all-exit cleanup. The canonical
count remains 42 complete, 13 partial, and 5 missing: 48.5/60 (80.8%).

Regression evidence on 2026-07-14: example 188 passed independently in 56.62
seconds. The single coordinated eight-worker suite then passed 410/410 in
395.4 seconds with flushed monotonic `n/410` progress. That is within normal
full-run variation of the preceding 388.7-second run, so no isolated speedup is
claimed. The Release solution build completed with zero warnings and errors,
and source inspection finds zero direct `lexer.lex`, `ast.lower`, or
`symbols.collect` calls in the LLVM text emitter.

## D154 - Interpolation Reuses Prepared Source Syntax

Status: interpolation source analysis prepared once for LLVM emission
Date: 2026-07-14

`smalllang.compiler.ir.interpolation` now exposes `lowerPrepared`. It accepts
the source's already prepared AST, token, and symbol products and performs only
the interpolation-specific work. The compatible `lower source` entry point
still builds those inputs for standalone callers such as example 209, then
delegates to the same implementation.

LLVM preparation creates one relocatable interpolation range per source and
stores all `InterpolationNode` records in one flat table. Parent and operand
indexes are shifted to package-global offsets while stored, then a source-local
view is reconstructed only where the existing expression emitter needs local
indexes. Runtime helper detection reads root nodes directly by range. Function
and `main` emission, integer/bool helper selection, and repeated string
references therefore no longer invoke `interpolation.lower` and no longer
re-lex, re-lower, or recollect the enclosing source.

Embedded `$(expression)` fragments still require their own expression-fragment
lexing and parsing because they are text inside a string token and are not part
of the enclosing module AST. That is semantic work unique to interpolation,
not duplicate module analysis. The current preparation makes source-local AST,
token, and symbol copies because affine arrays do not yet expose borrowed
slices; replacing those copies with range views remains an allocation
optimization, not a correctness gap.

This reuse slice does not promote a formal language gate. Progress remains 42
complete, 13 partial, and 5 missing: 48.5/60 (80.8%). Focused compatibility and
LLVM checks passed 2/2, the interpolation/LLVM group passed 9/9, the coordinated
eight-worker suite passed 410/410 in 398.0 seconds with monotonic progress, and
the Release build completed with zero warnings and errors. The full time is
again within the recent 388.7-395.4-second range and is not claimed as an
isolated speedup.


## D155 - Functions Declare Closed Capability Effect Sets

Status: reference compiler propagation implemented; self-host product pending
Date: 2026-07-14

SmallLang functions are pure by default and place a closed capability set after
the return type: `-> Unit uses Console` or `-> Result<T, Text> uses File,
Clock`. The initial names are `Console`, `File`, `Clock`, `Random`, `Process`,
and `Environment`. Unknown and duplicate names are rejected. Every ordinary,
local, generic, block, member, zero-input, and imported call checks that the
caller contains the callee's required set. `main` is the unrestricted program
boundary. Memory-map construction and mapped-view `flush` require `File`
directly because they are syntax forms rather than function calls.

`async` remains an execution/suspension property, not an authority token. This
keeps CPU-pure scheduling separate from clock or I/O permission and leaves a
clean future path for `handle` role blocks to discharge handled effects. The
standard library declares its public capability contracts, and the self-host
LLVM emitter declares `Console` through its nested output helpers. Generic
specialization validation now snapshots and restores the caller semantic
context; without that restoration, validating a pure specialization could
incorrectly erase the enclosing caller's effect set.

Examples and diagnostics cover positive transitive propagation, missing direct
and transitive Console effects, unknown and duplicate effects, File-backed map
syntax, async Clock functions, generic-call context restoration, role blocks,
and owned file APIs. This slice does not promote a formal roadmap gate because
the flat self-host effect analysis product and handler discharge are not yet
implemented. The canonical count remains 42 complete, 13 partial, and 5
missing: 48.5/60 (80.8%).

Regression evidence on 2026-07-14: the focused effect set passed 5/5, file and
mapped-I/O migration passed 7/7, grammar/effect snapshot corrections passed
5/5, and the coordinated eight-worker full suite passed 416/416 in 393.2
seconds with flushed monotonic `n/416` progress. The Release solution build
completed with zero warnings and errors.

## D156 - Self-Host Effects Are A Flat Context-Derived Product

Status: declaration and call propagation implemented; handler discharge pending
Date: 2026-07-14

`smalllang.compiler.semantic.effects` derives one source-qualified
`FunctionEffect` record per function and structured `EffectDiagnostic` records
from a borrowed `CompilationContext`. Effect masks use stable bits for Console,
File, Clock, Random, Process, and Environment. The pass reads the context's
flat source ranges, AST, tokens, symbols, and resolved calls; it does not lex,
parse, collect symbols, or resolve modules again. Unknown and duplicate
declarations are recorded before missing-caller diagnostics, and `main` remains
the unrestricted root boundary.

The prepared call product now retains unresolved flow calls long enough to
match qualified imports, resolves lexical local functions by owner symbol, and
assigns stable negative symbols to global runtime aliases including console,
file, random, and clock operations. This closes two pre-existing self-host
gaps exposed by effect propagation. The grammar VM also now permits newlines
after local function declarations, matching the reference parser's existing
behavior.

Example 297 prepares one `CompilationContext` and passes it to
`effects.analyzeContext`. It proves pure, multi-effect, local, imported, and
builtin-alias facts and diagnostics across all six initial capability names.
The design follows the subset rule used by Unison abilities and Koka effect
types. Handler subtraction is reserved for separately declared user-defined
effect operations; fixed external capabilities cannot be erased by an
ordinary role block. User-defined effect operations and their handler lowering
remain explicit gaps, so no formal gate is promoted and progress remains
48.5/60 (80.8%).

Regression evidence on 2026-07-14: the call/grammar/effect focused set passed
22/22, including the generic-role `yield` regression and example 297. The
coordinated eight-worker full suite then passed 417/417 in 397.4 seconds with
flushed monotonic `n/417` progress. The Release solution build completed with
zero warnings and errors.

## D157 - Fixed Capabilities Are Not User-Handleable Effects

Status: fixed capability boundary and self-host map/flush parity implemented;
user-defined effect signatures pending
Date: 2026-07-14

Console, File, Clock, Random, Process, and Environment describe authority over
real external resources. Letting a normal `handle` role subtract one of these
bits without replacing its runtime implementation would allow a function to
be typed as pure while it still prints, reads files, or starts processes. SL
therefore does not treat the closed capability set as user-handleable algebraic
effects.

This matches the capability interpretation in modern Effekt and the evidence
boundary used by Koka: fixed resources remain explicit requirements, while a
future user-defined effect signature may be installed and discharged by a
matching lexical handler. The accepted ordinary `handle` block-function form
remains the surface mechanism, but it gains no authority merely from its name.

The self-host grammar now recognizes `map read` and `map write` as a distinct
AST kind. `semantic.effects` derives File requirements for map construction
directly from the prepared AST and for mapped-view `flush` through stable
runtime alias -114. A lexically resolved user function named `flush` still
wins over the runtime alias. Example 297 proves missing File diagnostics for
both forms and positive `uses File` coverage without rebuilding syntax.

No formal gate is promoted: effect signatures, typed operations, lexical
handler matching, capability non-escape, nested-handler selection, and LLVM
handler lowering remain. Progress stays 48.5/60 (80.8%).

Regression evidence on 2026-07-14: the focused map/grammar/effect set passed
12/12; the coordinated eight-worker full suite passed 417/417 in 392.1 seconds
with flushed monotonic `n/417` progress. The Release solution build completed
with zero warnings and errors.

## D158 - User Effects Are Typed Module Symbols

Status: self-host declaration and call analysis implemented; execution pending
Date: 2026-07-14

User-defined handleable effects use module-level declarations whose operations
have ordinary static input and return types:

```smalllang
public effect Failure {
    fail message: Text -> Int
}

parse text: Text -> Int uses Failure {
    text -> fail
}
```

The generated grammar, self-host AST, and symbol collector represent effects
and their operations directly. `semantic.user_effects` derives flat
`UserEffectSignature`, `UserEffectOperation`, `UserEffectRequirement`,
`UserEffectCall`, and `UserEffectDiagnostic` tables from one borrowed
`CompilationContext`; it does not rebuild source syntax or module resolution.
Qualified requirements such as `uses fx.Failure` obey normal module aliases and
public visibility. Bare operation calls are selected only from the caller's
declared user effects, while an ordinary resolved lexical function wins. An
explicit same-module `Failure.fail` call without `uses Failure` is diagnosed;
qualification never grants authority.

Example 298 proves public and private signatures, typed zero/one-input operation
facts, qualified requirements, ordinary operation calls, duplicate operation
names, unknown and private imported effects, and a missing-`uses` call. The
closed Console/File/Clock/Random/Process/Environment capabilities remain a
separate non-handleable set.

This is deliberately a self-host frontend slice. The reference parser does not
yet accept effect declarations, imported explicit operation calls without
`uses` need a direct diagnostic path, and canonical operation type checking,
lexical handler matching, capability non-escape, nested selection, resumptions,
and LLVM lowering remain. User effect operations are therefore not claimed as
runtime-executable, and the formal roadmap score stays 48.5/60 (80.8%).

Regression evidence on 2026-07-14: the Release solution build completed with
zero warnings and errors; the focused grammar/module/call/effect slice passed
26/26, including the long LLVM overlap selected by substring filters; and the
coordinated eight-worker full suite passed 418/418 in 431.5 seconds with
flushed monotonic `n/418` completion records.

## D159 - User Effect Operations Carry Canonical Types

Status: self-host semantic analysis implemented; runtime handling pending
Date: 2026-07-15

User-effect operation input and return annotations resolve to the same
canonical type IDs used by expression analysis. Calls retain their argument and
return IDs, diagnose zero/one-input arity mismatches, and compare argument types
without spelling-based aliases. Explicit imported `Effect.operation` calls use
normal alias, visibility, and `uses` resolution. Example 299 fixes the flat
operation/call/diagnostic contract. Handler matching, resumptions, reference
parser support, and LLVM execution remain open, so the roadmap score is not
promoted.

## D160 - Regression Selection Follows Stable Compiler Layers

Status: implemented
Date: 2026-07-15

The example runner supports exact names, changed-source dependency selection,
and `reference`, `semantic`, `selfhost`, `llvm`, `fast`, and `full` suites.
Development checks can therefore prove the affected compiler layer quickly,
while one unfiltered full run remains the commit gate. All modes retain flushed
`[n/total]` progress and zero-warning Release bootstrap verification.

## D161 - Self-Host LLVM Fixtures Reuse One Native SL Compiler

Status: implemented for emitter fixtures
Date: 2026-07-15

Thirty-seven emitter fixtures formerly rebuilt the same multi-file self-host
compiler through the C# reference compiler. One representative split measured
56.05 seconds for that outer build, 0.02 seconds for the generated compiler to
emit LLVM, and 0.01 seconds for `llvm-as`. The runner now bootstraps one native
SL driver and reuses it across Windows, Linux, and Wasm cases. The original
bootstrap passed source modules as literal process arguments; D163 replaces
that temporary boundary with mapped source-file paths. Freshness covers
the reference compiler output, driver manifest, listed SL sources, and standard
library. The two non-emitter introspection cases keep their original path.

Measured verification: cold driver bootstrap took 56.7 seconds. With the driver
current, all 39 self-host LLVM tests passed in 4.1 seconds; individual emitter
fixtures completed in roughly 0.02-0.26 seconds. This replaces repeated
whole-compiler compilation with the intended bootstrap-once architecture.

## D162 - Owned Array Push Transfers Rather Than Copies

Status: reference semantic and LLVM lowering implemented
Date: 2026-07-15

Pushing a named value whose type owns storage into `[T; ~]` is a move. The
array receives the exact aggregate bits, the source binding becomes unavailable
immediately, and only the array drops the element. This replaces the former
restriction that accepted only freshly constructed owned arguments. It also
makes affine mapped-file owners collectable for a future file-based self-host
compiler without copying mappings or weakening deterministic unmapping.

The LLVM representation of `MappedBytes` and `MutableMappedBytes` is now a
first-class `%smalllang.mapped_bytes` aggregate inside generic arrays. Array
growth copies the aggregate, source-owner removal suppresses the old drop, and
element cleanup extracts the base mapping and length before unmapping exactly
once. Example 300 proves a mapped source owner array; example 301 proves a boxed
user value move; the negative diagnostic proves use-after-move rejection.
Owned element extraction by index remains separate work, so the formal gate
count remains 42 complete, 13 partial, 5 missing (48.5/60, 80.8%).

## D163 - Native slc Owns Mapped Source Files

Status: file-backed stage-1 emission and reusable test bootstrap implemented;
toolchain invocation and stage-2 comparison pending
Date: 2026-07-15

`sys.file.SourceText` is the affine owner for compiler input. It stores a
bounded UTF-8 view plus the hidden base mapping needed for deterministic
unmapping. Syntax entry points accept `SourceText` directly, and
`semantic.context.prepareFiles` owns all module mappings for the lifetime of a
single immutable `CompilationContext`. Compatibility entry points for borrowed
`Text` remain available.

The native `selfhost-slc-driver` accepts a target mode followed by source-file
paths. It maps every module, creates non-escaping `Text` views for the existing
LLVM emitter, and keeps the mapping owners alive until emission completes. The
example runner builds this stage-1 executable only when its compiler, manifest,
SL modules, or standard library inputs are newer; all emitter fixtures then
reuse it and pass materialized source paths rather than embedding whole source
programs in process arguments.

This path exposed a latent Windows runtime defect: generated functions larger
than one committed stack page called an empty `__chkstk`. The runtime now probes
each 4096-byte page while preserving the Windows x64 `__chkstk` register
contract. The 234KB self-host `emitCore` frame therefore grows the guarded
stack safely. A Windows stage-1 executable compiled two source files to LLVM,
exited with code 0, and the result passed `llvm-as`; the same pipeline passed
under Linux ASan. A cold focused test took 59.7 seconds including bootstrap,
while the current native `slc` warm path took 1.1 seconds total and 0.12 seconds
for self-host compilation.

The formal roadmap score remains 42 complete, 13 partial, 5 missing
(48.5/60, 80.8%): stage 1 emits valid LLVM from files, but it does not yet
invoke the platform linker itself or prove a reproducible stage-2 compiler.

## D164 - Native slc Reuses a Bootstrap and Drives the Host Toolchain

Status: stage-1 native build orchestration implemented; reproducible stage 2
pending
Date: 2026-07-15

The reusable native `selfhost-slc-driver` now has a `build-windows` mode. It
self-invokes its existing multi-file emitter, redirects the emitted LLVM IR to
a named file through `sys.process.runToFile`, and passes that IR to the pinned
Clang driver. Clang remains responsible for the target backend, assembler, and
linker pipeline; SL owns source mapping, module compilation, argv construction,
exit-code checking, and artifact selection. No command shell or command-string
parsing is involved.

`runToFile` accepts a typed `RunToFileRequest { argv, output }`. Windows uses
`CreateProcessW` with explicitly inherited standard handles and correct Windows
argv quoting. Linux redirects the child stdout descriptor around the existing
`posix_spawnp` path. Example 306 proves literal argv preservation, output-file
creation, the child exit code, and captured bytes; example 87 continues to
prove the ordinary inherited-output process path.

One C#-bootstrapped native stage-1 driver compiled a two-module SL program,
invoked Clang, produced a Windows executable, and ran it with
`module answer = 42`. The example runner now builds the reusable driver at
`-O0` and includes its bootstrap configuration in freshness inputs. This keeps
the one-time native bootstrap near 2.5 seconds instead of spending roughly a
minute optimizing a compiler that is immediately reused for small fixtures.
The coordinated self-host suite passed 166/166 in 40.5 seconds including a
cold reusable-driver rebuild; individual LLVM emitter fixtures remained around
0.02-0.35 seconds.

LLVM allocas discovered during function lowering are now buffered and emitted
once in the entry block. An `alloca` inside a loop otherwise consumes new stack
space on every iteration until function return, making an unoptimized native
compiler depend on optimizer hoisting. The buffered representation is linear
to render and avoids the quadratic cost of repeatedly inserting text into the
already emitted module. Windows native images retain an 8 MiB reserved stack
and the real `__chkstk` probe from D163.

A full 27-module stage-2 attempt now crosses file mapping, parser, semantic
analysis, and typed-IR lowering and reaches self-host LLVM emission. It does
not yet produce a complete stage-2 module: the self-host emitter still lacks
the complete compiler-sized lowering surface. The formal score therefore
remains 42 complete, 13 partial, 5 missing (48.5/60, 80.8%).

Final coordinated verification passed 428/428 examples and diagnostics with
eight workers in 37.0 seconds. The Release solution build completed with zero
warnings and zero errors.

## D165 - Deterministic Grammar VM with Failure Memoization

Status: implemented and regression-tested
Date: 2026-07-15

Generated optional and repeated productions now commit after a successful
match, matching the existing committed-alternative bytecode instead of leaving
successful choice points available to unrelated caller failures. The grammar
VM also memoizes failed `(rule, token)` pairs in a collision-free table sized
to the current token stream. This bounds repeated negative parsing while
preserving the lossless event rollback used by CST construction.

Deterministic repetition exposed `else` as the only contextual terminator that
could also parse as a general identifier expression. Grammar opcode 8 and the
`notKeyword("else")` predicate now guard subject and expression `when` arms
without consuming input. The contextual enum-pattern and CFG suspension tests
cover both forms.

The reusable native stage-1 compiler remains an `-O0` bootstrap because it
builds in about 2.3 seconds and is cached until compiler inputs change. In the
compiler-sized 27-module probe, the corrected `-O0` executable reached the
known stage-2 emitter trap in 26.3 seconds; an independently cached `-O2`
stage-1 reached the same point in 8.9 seconds, but cost 83.5 seconds to rebuild.
The ordinary test loop therefore keeps the fast cold bootstrap, while a stable
optimized stage-1 is useful for repeated full-compiler work.

## D166 - Fast Regression Reuses Stage 1; Stage 2 Is a Separate Gate

Status: reusable regression path complete; stage-2 LLVM assembly pending
Date: 2026-07-15

The example runner treats the native `selfhost-slc-driver` as a freshness-keyed
stage-1 artifact. It is rebuilt only when the driver manifest, compiler DLL,
self-host modules, standard library, or bootstrap configuration changes. All
self-host LLVM fixtures then invoke that executable directly and may run in
parallel. A current emitter-affected selection passed 40/40 in 7.9 seconds,
with most native cases taking 0.02-0.20 seconds. The full regression passed
432/432 in 49.8 seconds while reusing the current driver.

Compiler self-reproduction remains a deliberately separate, expensive gate.
One stage-1 process now owns a flat `CompilationContext`, analyzes all 27
compiler modules once, and emits the complete stage-2 module without rebuilding
the compiler per source or per fixture. The latest completed emission produced
47,574 LLVM lines in 340.1 seconds. This is not part of the ordinary edit-test
loop: bootstrap/release verification regenerates it only when its freshness key
changes, then runs `llvm-as`, the platform linker, and the multi-file smoke
program.

The stage-2 emitter now covers imported composite return inference, transparent
operator operands, mutable initializer scheduling, loop-local member/length/
index recomputation, target-width length conversion, and struct literals inside
control-flow regions. LLVM assembly is still an open checklist item; a completed
text emission alone must not promote the self-hosting gate.

Checklist:

- [x] Reuse one native stage-1 compiler across self-host LLVM fixtures.
- [x] Rebuild the artifact only when a declared freshness input changes.
- [x] Share one borrowed flat `CompilationContext` across the 27-module build.
- [x] Keep monotonic `n/total` output and parallel affected/full regression.
- [x] Complete stage-2 text emission without a native crash.
- [x] Assemble the complete stage-2 IR with `llvm-as`.
- [ ] Link and run the stage-2 compiler.
- [ ] Compile and execute a multi-file SL smoke program with stage 2.

## D167 - Lift Local Functions Before Parallel Native Optimization

Status: reference closure conversion and parallel native build implemented;
stage-2 runtime linkage and parallel frontend analysis pending
Date: 2026-07-17

Local SL functions previously remained inline in the reference LLVM emitter.
The compiler-sized `emitCore` therefore became one roughly 830-thousand-line
LLVM function. Splitting the module into 24 partitions did not split that
function: 23 small partitions completed quickly while one Clang process used a
single core for more than 904 seconds and exceeded 9 GB working set.

Semantic analysis now preserves each function's lexical capture types.
Code generation closure-converts ordinary local functions into uniquely named
LLVM functions, passes captures as hidden aggregate parameters, restores the
complete lexical sibling scope, and gives every lifted function its own stack
placement plan. Read-only slices and dictionary views are valid capture ABI
values. User block functions remain inline because their caller block is a
distinct callback-like contract.

After lifting, all 24 `-O1` partitions of the reusable native stage-1 compiler
completed during a cold test bootstrap in seconds instead of hitting the
904-second timeout. The fast regression passed 392/392 with eight workers in
44.46 seconds. The optimized stage-1 emitted the complete 4,651,009-byte
stage-2 LLVM module in 293.32 seconds; `llvm-as` produced a valid 1,345,496-byte
bitcode module, and its 24 native object partitions compiled in 1.17 seconds.

The remaining stage-2 gate is runtime/product linkage. The assembled module
does not yet provide the Windows entry shim and all runtime/stdlib definitions,
so `smalllang_start`, allocation/printing helpers, and imported SL module
symbols remain unresolved at final link. Frontend semantic and typed-IR work
also remains sequential; its 293-second emission time is separate from the now
parallel native backend.
