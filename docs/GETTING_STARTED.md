# Sollang Guide

Status: current implementation guide
Updated: 2026-07-22

This guide keeps the longer project notes out of the README while preserving the
details needed to build, run, and understand the current Sollang implementation.

Sollang has completed its measured 60/60 self-hosting roadmap. The C# compiler
remains the bootstrap/reference implementation; the Sollang-written compiler
reads multi-file programs, analyzes them, emits LLVM IR, and drives native
Windows/Linux builds. The accepted language specification and decision log
remain authoritative for syntax and compatibility.

## What Works Today

- `main { ... }` or omitted `main` with top-level executable statements
- zero-argument functions with `getName: -> Text { ... }`
- one-input functions with default `it` or an explicit input name:
  `square: Int -> Int { ... }` and `square n: Int -> Int { ... }`
- single-expression function bodies with `name: Input -> Output => expression`
- local functions declared inside a function body, scoped to that containing
  function
- expression-first bindings with `"value" => name`, `getName => name`, and
  `7 -> square => num`
- integer `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, unary `-`, and parenthesized expressions
- line comments with `#`
- `Bool` values from `true`/`false`, integer comparisons, and `and`/`or`/`not`
- flow-oriented conditionals with `condition -> if { ... } else { ... }`
- multi-branch `when { condition { ... } else { ... } }` expressions
- subject-value `when` with `value -> when { >= limit { ... } else { ... } }`
- subject-value `when` range arms with `value -> when { start..end { ... } }`
- compact `when` arms with `condition => value`, including implicit `it`
  subject inside one-input functions
- string interpolation with `"Hello, $name"`
- interpolation of string and integer bindings
- value-flow calls with `value -> function`
- value-flow calls with extra receiver arguments, such as
  `values! -> push(30)`
- value-flow target-call syntax with `value -> function()`
- parenthesized calls with `function(value)`
- Sollang standard library functions `sys.io.print`, `sys.io.println`, and
  `sys.io.readInt` with global `print`, `println`, and `readInt` aliases
- `namespace` declarations and imports whose last path segment is the default
  alias (`import sample.math`), with optional explicit renaming through
  `import sample.math as mathApi`
- integer input with `"n = ? " -> readInt => n` or
  `"n = ? " -> sys.io.readInt => n`
- line output with `value -> println` or `value -> sys.io.println`, plus
  `println()` for an empty line
- block-function calls with `range -> each item { ... }` and
  `count -> repeat item { ... }`, where the brace block is the call argument and
  `each()`/`repeat()` are intentionally omitted
- closed integer range loops with `1..9 -> each i { ... }`
- default loop item binding with `1..9 -> each { ... }`, exposed as `it`
- integer folds with `range -> fold initial acc, item { nextAcc }`
- fixed `Int` arrays with `[1, 2, 3]` and `[0; 8]`
- growable `Int` arrays with `[1, 2, ~]`, typed empty `[Int; ~]`, and
  capacity hint `[Int; 1024~]`
- `{Int: Int}` dictionaries with `{ 1: 100, 2: 200 }` and typed empty
  `{Int: Int}` or capacity hint `{Int: Int; 1024~}`
- checked indexing with `array[index]` and `dictionary[key]`
- mutable owner bindings with `value => name!`
- checked indexed assignment with `value => owner![index]`
- move-consuming container transforms with `append(value)` and
  `updated(keyOrIndex, value)`
- readonly `[Int]` and `{Int: Int}`, mutable-borrow `mut [Int; ~]` and
  `mut {Int: Int}`, and explicit `move` growable array/dictionary parameters
  that may return the consumed input owner
- deterministic native cleanup for heap-owning dynamic arrays and dictionaries
- automatic allocation-free stack payloads for small dynamic-array and
  dictionary literals whose owners remain local and readonly
- function-entry stack-frame planning with lifetime-based slot reuse across
  nested branches and loop iterations
- automatic heap placement for fixed arrays that exceed the planned stack
  budget
- compile-time `Int` value generics with explicit fluent specialization, such
  as `value -> fill[4]`, including symbolic fixed-array repeat counts
- fixed-array value-generic parameters such as `[Int; N]`, with compile-time
  size checking at calls like `values -> fixedLength<3>`
- purpose-oriented pseudo-random integer generation with `seedRandom` and
  `randomBelow`
- binary sorted `Int` file writing and nearest-value lookup with
  `openIntWriter`, `writeInt`, `openIntReader`, and `closestInt`
- source-generated lexing from `syntax/sollang.lexer`
- source-generated parsing from `syntax/sollang.grammar`
- LLVM IR generation
- Windows x64 executable linking through `clang` and `lld-link`
- Linux x64 executable linking through Windows LLVM object generation and WSL
  `cc`
- browser WebAssembly module linking through `clang` and `wasm-ld`
- generic `[T; N]`/`[T; ~]` arrays and `{K: V}` Swiss-table dictionaries,
  including local/imported nominal keys with static `Hash`/`Eq`
- explicit readonly `ref T` origins, move-path checking, deterministic nested
  owner cleanup, and explicit owned `dyn<Trait>` dispatch
- explicit user-value binary serialization through
  `sys.file.BinarySerializable`
- native `sollang test`, parser-backed `sollang format`, JSON-RPC
  `sollang language-server`, deterministic package/workspace locks, and
  content-validated incremental builds

Executable size depends on the selected target, optimization level, runtime
features, and LLVM version. Use the dated files under `benchmarks/` for measured
snapshots rather than treating an old linker size as a language guarantee.

## Build And Run

The examples are named so a normal filename sort follows the grammar
progression. Start with the basic function/value-flow sample:

```powershell
.\scripts\sollang.ps1 -Source examples\01-function-basic-hello.slg -Output artifacts\01-function-basic-hello.exe -KeepTemps
.\scripts\sollang.ps1 -Source examples\02-function-named-input.slg -Output artifacts\02-function-named-input.exe -KeepTemps
.\scripts\sollang.ps1 -Source examples\03-flow-call-parens.slg -Output artifacts\03-flow-call-parens.exe -KeepTemps
```

Top-level statements, local functions, arithmetic, comments, and block functions
are cumulative:

```powershell
.\scripts\sollang.ps1 -Source examples\04-main-omitted-top-level.slg -Output artifacts\04-main-omitted-top-level.exe -KeepTemps
.\scripts\sollang.ps1 -Source examples\05-function-local.slg -Output artifacts\05-function-local.exe -KeepTemps
.\scripts\sollang.ps1 -Source examples\06-expression-arithmetic-comments.slg -Output artifacts\06-expression-arithmetic-comments.exe -KeepTemps
.\scripts\sollang.ps1 -Source examples\07-block-each-explicit-item.slg -Output artifacts\07-block-each-explicit-item.exe -KeepTemps
.\scripts\sollang.ps1 -Source examples\08-block-each-default-it.slg -Output artifacts\08-block-each-default-it.exe -KeepTemps
.\scripts\sollang.ps1 -Source examples\09-namespace-sys-io.slg -Output artifacts\09-namespace-sys-io.exe -KeepTemps
.\scripts\sollang.ps1 -Source examples\10-block-argument-omits-parens.slg -Output artifacts\10-block-argument-omits-parens.exe -KeepTemps

.\scripts\sollang.ps1 -Source examples\13-block-fold-sum.slg -Output artifacts\13-block-fold-sum.exe -KeepTemps
```

Conditionals are cumulative:

```powershell
.\scripts\sollang.ps1 -Source examples\14-condition-if.slg -Output artifacts\14-condition-if.exe -KeepTemps
.\scripts\sollang.ps1 -Source examples\15-condition-when.slg -Output artifacts\15-condition-when.exe -KeepTemps
.\scripts\sollang.ps1 -Source examples\16-condition-when-subject.slg -Output artifacts\16-condition-when-subject.exe -KeepTemps
.\scripts\sollang.ps1 -Source examples\17-condition-when-range.slg -Output artifacts\17-condition-when-range.exe -KeepTemps
.\scripts\sollang.ps1 -Source examples\18-condition-when-compact.slg -Output artifacts\18-condition-when-compact.exe -KeepTemps
```

The sorted-number workflow is also written in Sollang. For quick verification,
the demo pair uses the same algorithm at 1,000 records:

```powershell
.\scripts\sollang.ps1 -Source examples\19-stdlib-random-file-demo-generate.slg -Output artifacts\19-stdlib-random-file-demo-generate.exe -KeepTemps
.\artifacts\19-stdlib-random-file-demo-generate.exe
.\scripts\sollang.ps1 -Source examples\20-stdlib-file-demo-query.slg -Output artifacts\20-stdlib-file-demo-query.exe -KeepTemps
.\artifacts\20-stdlib-file-demo-query.exe
```

The full generator creates 100,000,000 sorted 64-bit integer records in
`artifacts/random-sorted-100m.i64` by choosing one pseudo-random value from each
10-wide bucket in `1..1,000,000,000`:

```powershell
.\scripts\sollang.ps1 -Source examples\21-stdlib-random-file-100m-generate.slg -Output artifacts\21-stdlib-random-file-100m-generate.exe -KeepTemps
.\artifacts\21-stdlib-random-file-100m-generate.exe

.\scripts\sollang.ps1 -Source examples\22-stdlib-file-100m-query.slg -Output artifacts\22-stdlib-file-100m-query.exe -KeepTemps
.\artifacts\22-stdlib-file-100m-query.exe
```

Linux x64 output is available through WSL:

```powershell
.\scripts\sollang.ps1 -Source examples\01-function-basic-hello.slg -Output artifacts\01-function-basic-hello-linux -Target linux-x64 -KeepTemps
wsl --exec /mnt/p/MyWorks/Sollang/artifacts/01-function-basic-hello-linux
```

Structured async uses the same source syntax on Windows and Linux. For example,
the generic sendable-input coverage can be built and executed through WSL with:

```powershell
.\scripts\sollang.ps1 `
  -Source examples\238-sendable-async-inputs.slg `
  -Output artifacts\238-sendable-async-inputs-linux `
  -Target linux-x64
wsl --exec /mnt/p/MyWorks/Sollang/artifacts/238-sendable-async-inputs-linux
```

Async calls start cooperative affine tasks. `await` consumes a task and returns
its value; `cancel` consumes it without producing a value. Cancellation is a
final flow target and does not use parentheses:

```sollang
5 -> parent => pending
0 -> gate => gateTask
gateTask -> await => ready
pending -> cancel
```

An unconsumed task is still joined by lexical scope cleanup. Explicit cancel is
for work whose result is no longer needed; it removes queued work and runs the
compiler-generated coroutine destroy path for initialized child and frame
owners.

`await` can suspend inside an `if` or `when` branch without flattening the source
control flow:

```sollang
choose value: Int -> async Int {
    value * 10 => saved
    value > 0 -> if {
        value -> step => pending
        pending -> await => next
        saved + next
    } else {
        saved
    }
}
```

The generated resume switch targets the branch continuation directly. Values
that cross the suspension move through the coroutine frame, and the branch join
merges their resumed representation before later statements execute.

The same suspension model applies inside `while`. Numbered states are stable
sites, not one-shot events, so a loop can revisit one site on every iteration:

```sollang
sum count: Int -> async Int {
    0 => index!
    0 => total!
    index! < count -> while {
        index! -> step => pending
        pending -> await => next
        total! + next => total!
        index! + 1 => index!
    }
    total!
}
```

The compiler carries mutable storage pointers through loop-header phis and
spills live values only while the child is pending. `break`, `continue`, and
their compact guarded forms preserve that state across early loop edges:

```sollang
pending -> await => next
index! + 1 => index!
index! == 2 -> if continue
total! + next => total!
index! == 4 -> if break
```

Body-local owners are dropped before either transfer. An outer owner required
by the next iteration or after loop exit must remain initialized on every
incoming edge; inconsistent consumption is a compile-time error.

Long CPU work can explicitly cooperate with the executor using bare `yield`:

```sollang
scan count: Int -> async Int {
    0 => index!
    index! < count -> while {
        # Perform one bounded piece of CPU work.
        index! + 1 => index!
        yield
    }
    index!
}
```

`yield` spills live state, places the current Task at the back of the ready
queue, and resumes at the following statement. If its owner cancels the queued
Task, the compiler-generated state destroy path drops the frame instead. This
bare async statement is distinct from `value -> yield`, which still transfers a
value from a user-defined block function.

Use typed durations for nonblocking time suspension:

```sollang
refresh: -> async Int {
    250 -> milliseconds -> sleep -> await
    1
}
```

`sleep` returns an affine `Task<Unit>`, so it follows the same `await` or
`cancel` ownership rule as every other Task. Sleeping work leaves the ready
queue and enters a deadline-ordered timer queue; the executor runs other work
and waits for the nearest timer only when nothing is runnable. `seconds` is
available when that unit reads better. Zero or negative durations complete
immediately.

Generic binary scalar reads can suspend without blocking the cooperative
executor:

```sollang
import sys.file as file

readHeader: -> async Result<Option<UInt16>, Text> {
    file.readAsync<UInt16> => pending
    pending -> await
}
```

`readAsync<T>` has the same `Ok(Some(value))`, `Ok(None)`, and Text error
contract as synchronous `read<T>`. All native reads share one background file
worker and return through the Task ready queue; cancellation uses the ordinary
affine `task -> cancel` rule. The current reader is cursor-based and global, so
await every submitted read before closing or reopening it.

For concurrent or random-access work, prefer the owned File surface:

```sollang
file.openReadAsync("values.bin") => opening
opening -> await => opened
opened -> when {
    Ok(reader) {
        reader -> readAtAsync<UInt16>(0) => header
        reader -> readAtAsync<UInt16>(4096) => record
        header -> await => headerValue
        record -> await => recordValue
    }
    Err(error) => error
}
```

The `UInt64` argument is a byte offset. `File` is affine and automatically
closed; each pending read Task owns a duplicated OS handle and is therefore
safe even if completion order differs from submission order. The open Task
owns its path bytes and transfers the new handle only through a successful
`await`.

Random-access output uses a distinct affine writer capability:

```sollang
file.openWriteAsync("values.bin") => opening
opening -> await => opened
opened -> when {
    Ok(writer) {
        writer -> writeAt(UInt16(513), 0)
        writer -> writeAtAsync<UInt16>(1027, 3) => pending
        pending -> await => written
        writer -> syncAsync => syncing
        syncing -> await => durable
    }
    Err(error) => error
}
```

The first form infers `UInt16`; the second contextually types the literal.
Every write is position-based and all-or-error. An asynchronous write copies
the scalar and owns a duplicated OS handle, so the original writer can close
independently; `await` returns `Result<Unit, Text>`. The writer closes
automatically at owner-scope exit. `syncAsync` is the explicit durability
barrier for data and metadata already submitted to the shared file worker.

Browser WebAssembly output is available through the `wasm32-browser` target. The
generated module exports `sollang_start` and `memory`, and imports
`env.slg_browser_write(ptr, len)` so the page can render stdout text:

```powershell
.\scripts\sollang.ps1 -Source examples\23-webassembly-browser.slg -Output artifacts\23-webassembly-browser.wasm -Target wasm32-browser -KeepTemps
python -m http.server 5080
```

Open `http://localhost:5080/examples/browser/`.

The first container sample shows static arrays, dynamic arrays, checked
indexing, `fold`, `push`, dictionary `put`, `len`, `capacity`, and deterministic
native cleanup:

```powershell
.\scripts\sollang.ps1 -Source examples\25-arrays-dictionaries.slg -Output artifacts\25-arrays-dictionaries.exe -KeepTemps
.\artifacts\25-arrays-dictionaries.exe
```

Move-consuming container transforms return a new owner while consuming the
source owner. The sample shows the short same-name form:

```powershell
.\scripts\sollang.ps1 -Source examples\26-immutable-containers.slg -Output artifacts\26-immutable-containers.exe -KeepTemps
.\artifacts\26-immutable-containers.exe
```

The dictionary hash-table sample exercises update, growth, rehashing, lookup,
and capacity reporting:

```powershell
.\scripts\sollang.ps1 -Source examples\27-dictionary-hash-table.slg -Output artifacts\27-dictionary-hash-table.exe -KeepTemps
.\artifacts\27-dictionary-hash-table.exe
```

On first use, the script downloads LLVM 22.1.8 into `.tools`. LLVM binaries,
build outputs, and generated executables are intentionally ignored by Git.
On Windows, optimized native compilation keeps LLVM IR up to 1 MiB in one
module and adds one partition per additional MiB, capped by the logical CPU
count. Set `SOLLANG_NATIVE_JOBS` to a positive integer to apply a lower cap when
measuring constrained or highly concurrent build environments.

Example stdout tests compile and run the samples listed under
`examples/expected`:

Each new `.slg` example begins with a short English `#` comment explaining the
language behavior or compiler invariant it verifies. Multi-scenario examples
also label the intent of each scenario so the source remains useful as
executable documentation, not only as a regression input.

```powershell
dotnet run --project tests\Sollang.ExampleTests\Sollang.ExampleTests.csproj --no-build
```

During development, repeat `--filter` for name fragments, use `--exact` for a
complete test name, or repeat `--affected` with repository-relative changed
paths. `--suite reference|semantic|selfhost|llvm|fast|full` selects a stable
layer. Add `--skip-bootstrap` only after the Release compiler and generated
grammar table have already been verified in the current checkout:

```powershell
dotnet run --project tests\Sollang.ExampleTests\Sollang.ExampleTests.csproj `
  -c Release --no-build -- --filter 219 --filter 220 --skip-bootstrap
```

The runner uses up to eight isolated test workers by default. It starts the
remaining expensive cases first and uses a load-balancing partitioner so a
worker that finishes a short case immediately takes the next remaining case.
Self-host LLVM emitter tests bootstrap one Sollang compiler driver and then reuse its
native executable for every Windows, Linux, and Wasm fixture. The driver is
rebuilt only when its compiler, manifest, Sollang sources, or standard library inputs
are newer; a current driver reports `[selfhost bootstrap] REUSE`. Thus the suite
does not compile the same self-host compiler modules once per fixture.
The generated parser commits successful optional/repeated branches and keeps a
per-rule negative-result table for the current token stream. Large self-host
modules therefore do not repeat the same failed parse from the same token.
Bootstrap phases are printed as `[bootstrap n/total]`. Every scheduled case is
printed as `[start n/total]`, and every completion is flushed immediately as
`[n/total] PASS|FAIL name (seconds)`, so long LLVM runs never appear idle.
Use `--jobs 1` for deterministic sequential diagnosis or an explicit positive
worker count when measuring another machine. Compiler bootstrap and
grammar-table determinism are still checked once before the parallel section.
Add `--compare-compilers` to an executable self-host LLVM fixture when
diagnosing backend drift. The runner materializes the fixture's embedded Sollang
sources once, emits LLVM with both the C# reference compiler and the native Sollang
compiler, keeps both `.ll` files under `artifacts/example-tests`, links both,
and requires identical exit codes and normalized stdout. It intentionally
compares observable behavior rather than raw LLVM text because the C# and Sollang
backends use different platform-runtime implementations.

Use the dedicated stage-2 gate to prove that a C#-bootstrapped Sollang compiler and
the Sollang compiler rebuilt by that compiler produce the same normalized LLVM:

```powershell
.\scripts\verify-selfhost-stage2.ps1
```

The script reports `[stage2 n/6]`, caches the complete stage-2 executable until
one of its 28 source inputs changes, compares normalized LLVM SHA-256 for both a
single source and an imported two-file program, assembles and links both stage-2
outputs, executes them, and finally runs the C#/Sollang runtime differential check.
Pass `-Rebuild` to force the complete stage-2 emission. These gates are opt-in
so the ordinary parallel edit loop does not pay for another full compiler
generation.
An unfiltered run always remains the commit-gate regression check.

Run the complete Linux x64 gate through WSL with the same 523-case inventory:

```powershell
.\scripts\verify-linux-full.ps1
```

The runner compiles ordinary examples and diagnostics for `linux-x64`, executes
native binaries inside WSL, and makes reusable self-host tests emit Linux LLVM.
Those self-host outputs are assembled for every case and linked/executed when
an observable runtime expectation exists. Linux uses four test workers by
default because higher concurrent WSL process counts made asynchronous file
readiness stress runs nondeterministic; this bounds the launcher without
serializing compiler and runtime coverage.

Multiple user source files may form one compilation unit. Declarations from all
files are merged after each file independently resolves its namespace and import
aliases. Exactly one file may contain executable top-level statements:

```powershell
.\scripts\sollang.ps1 `
  -SourcesFile examples\expected\52-multi-file-modules.sources.txt `
  -Output artifacts\52-multi-file-modules.exe
```

The source-list file contains one repository-relative `.slg` path per line.
Direct compiler use accepts the same files as positional arguments.

For a normal project, put the root module in a compact language-shaped
`sollang.project` manifest:

```sollang
project {
    name: "compiler"
    version: "0.1.0"
    root: "src/main.slg"
}
```

Running `sollang build` without source arguments searches the current
directory and its ancestors for that manifest. `--project` accepts either the
manifest or its directory. Relative roots are resolved inside the project and
may not escape it. Without `-o`, artifacts are written as
`build/<name>.exe`, `build/<name>`, or `build/<name>.wasm` for the selected
target. Command-line target, optimization, LLVM, and output options remain
explicit overrides.

Use `products` when one project produces several executables, and use
`dependencies` for exact local package paths:

```sollang
project {
    name: "tools"
    version: "0.1.0"
    products: {
        compiler: "src/compiler.slg"
        formatter: "src/formatter.slg"
    }
    dependencies: {
        syntax: {
            path: "../syntax"
            version: "^1.2.0"
        }
    }
}
```

`sollang build --product compiler` selects one product. A project with one
product needs no selection; a project with several reports the sorted choices
instead of silently choosing. Product and dependency names are import-safe
identifiers. Every dependency path is relative to the declaring manifest and
must point directly to a directory or `sollang.project` file; directory
traversal looking for a coincidental package is not performed.

The dependency key must equal the dependency project's `name`, and that package
must expose a product with the same name. Source imports use that first segment,
such as `import syntax.tree as tree`. Each package can see only its own direct
dependencies; a dependency's dependencies do not become ambient imports of the
parent. The compiler resolves the complete local graph in sorted order and
rejects dependency cycles, duplicate project names, malformed SemVer values,
and unsatisfied dependency versions before parsing sources. Requirements accept
`*`, exact versions, `^`, `~`, and whitespace-separated comparator
intersections such as `>=1.2.0 <2.0.0`.

Put tightly coupled local projects in one `sollang.workspace`:

```sollang
workspace {
    members: [
        "packages/base"
        "packages/math"
        "apps/app"
    ]
}
```

The members array deliberately carries paths only; each member's
`sollang.project` remains the single source of its package name, products, and
dependencies. Paths must be relative and remain inside the workspace. Duplicate
paths and names, empty workspaces, missing projects, and dependencies on an
undeclared local project are errors.

At the workspace root, select a package with
`sollang build --package app`; use `--product` as well only when that project
has multiple products. `--workspace <file-or-directory>` selects an explicit
workspace. From a member directory, a source-free build finds the nearest
project and enclosing workspace and selects that member automatically. Default
outputs live under
`build/<target>/<package>/<product>[.exe|.wasm]`, so different packages and
targets cannot overwrite one another. The workspace manifest participates in
the persistent frontend-cache identity. Run
`sollang resolve --workspace <file-or-directory>` to write the workspace's
canonical, sorted `sollang.lock`. Normal workspace builds update a stale lock;
`sollang build --locked` rejects a missing or stale lock for reproducible CI.
The lock records exact `name@version` dependency identities and normalized
local `path:` sources. A remote dependency uses a content-pinned Git record:

```sollang
dependencies: {
    syntax: {
        git: "https://github.com/example/syntax.git"
        rev: "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567"
        version: "^1.2.0"
    }
}
```

`rev` must be a complete 40- or 64-digit commit hash. The compiler materializes
that exact commit without a working-tree `.git` directory, rejects symbolic
links, hashes sorted paths, lengths, and bytes with SHA-256, and writes the
revision plus checksum to lock format 2. Cached bytes whose digest changes are
rejected. Registry packages use the same source record with a static HTTPS
index:

```sollang
dependencies: {
    text: {
        registry: "https://packages.example.com"
        version: "^1.0.0"
    }
}
```

Normal builds retain the version and SHA-256 already recorded in
`sollang.lock`; `sollang resolve` is the explicit update operation. The complete
index, archive, cache, and security contract is in
[PACKAGE_REGISTRY.md](PACKAGE_REGISTRY.md).

When only the root file is supplied, each non-`sys` import is mapped from its
dotted module path to a `.slg` file relative to the root directory. For example,
`import sample.math as math` discovers `sample/math.slg` recursively.
Imported module functions and nominal declarations are internal unless
explicitly exported:

```sollang
namespace sample.math

public double value: Int -> Int {
    value * 2
}
```

The same rule applies to `public struct`, `public enum`, and `public trait`.
Imported type paths use the import alias, for example `math.Counter`.

The compiler itself targets .NET 11 Preview and uses C# Preview.

## VS Code Extension

Sollang includes a local VS Code language support extension:

```powershell
Push-Location tools\vscode-sollang
npx --yes @vscode/vsce package --no-dependencies --allow-missing-repository
code --install-extension .\sollang-language-support-0.6.0.vsix

The extension registers `.slg`, highlights value-flow syntax, function
declarations, block-function calls, strings with interpolation, comments,
conditionals, types, and operators, and includes snippets for common forms.

See [tools/vscode-sollang/README.md](../tools/vscode-sollang/README.md) for
extension-specific notes.

## Formatting And Language Server

The compiler formats one or more valid Sollang source files in place with its
generated parser. `--check` performs the same parse and canonicalization but
returns a nonzero exit code instead of writing changed files:

```powershell
dotnet run --project src/Sollang.Compiler -- format src/main.slg
dotnet run --project src/Sollang.Compiler -- format --check src/main.slg
```

Editor integrations can use standard input without temporary files:

```powershell
Get-Content src/main.slg -Raw |
    dotnet run --project src/Sollang.Compiler -- format --stdin
```

`sollang language-server` speaks JSON-RPC/LSP over standard input and output.
It synchronizes whole documents, publishes diagnostics from the same generated
parser, and implements `textDocument/formatting`. The VS Code extension invokes
the parser-backed formatter directly; set `sollang.compilerPath` if the compiler
is not on `PATH`.

## Lexer Rules

Lexer rules are written in a compact DSL:

```text
token Identifier = identifier
token String = quoted_string
token Number = number
token LeftBrace = "{"
token RightBrace = "}"
token LeftParen = "("
token RightParen = ")"
token Range = ".."
token Tilde = "~"
token Dot = "."
token Comma = ","
token Semicolon = ";"
token Plus = "+"
token Minus = "-"
token Star = "*"
token Slash = "/"
token Percent = "%"
token Arrow = "->"
token FatArrow = "=>"
token Colon = ":"
token EqualEqual = "=="
token BangEqual = "!="
token Bang = "!"
token LessEqual = "<="
token GreaterEqual = ">="
token Less = "<"
token Greater = ">"
token Equal = "="
token NewLine = newline
token End = end
```

`src/Sollang.Compiler.Generators` reads `syntax/sollang.lexer` as an MSBuild
`AdditionalFiles` input and generates `TokenKind` and `Lexer` during the C#
build.

## Grammar Rules

Parser rules are also written in a compact DSL:

```text

rule LogicalAndExpression = EqualityExpression (Identifier("and") EqualityExpression)*
rule EqualityExpression = ComparisonExpression ((EqualEqual | BangEqual) ComparisonExpression)*
rule ComparisonExpression = AdditiveExpression ((Less | LessEqual | Greater | GreaterEqual) AdditiveExpression)*
rule AdditiveExpression = MultiplicativeExpression ((Plus | Minus) MultiplicativeExpression)*

rule TypeName = Identifier
rule TypeAnnotation = TypeName | LeftBracket TypeName RightBracket | LeftBracket TypeName Semicolon Tilde RightBracket | LeftBrace TypeName Colon TypeName RightBrace
```

The generator reads `syntax/sollang.grammar` and emits the current recursive
descent parser at compile time. Bindings use `=>`, so `n * i => value` is the
preferred binding style for new samples. Function targets in value-flow calls
omit empty parentheses, such as `7 -> square => num`; target parentheses are
reserved for additional receiver arguments, such as `values! -> push(30)`.
Block-function targets use the following brace block as the function's code
block argument: `1..9 -> each i { ... }`.

Range loops prefer `start..end -> each item { ... }`; when the item name is
omitted as `start..end -> each { ... }`, the loop item is available as `it`.
One-input functions follow the same naming shape: `square: Int -> Int` exposes
the input as `it`, while `square n: Int -> Int` exposes it as `n`. A function
whose body is a single expression may use `name: Input -> Output => expression`
instead of an outer body block.

Function declarations may appear at the start of another function body. These
local functions are visible only inside that containing function and nested
functions below it; the backend currently inlines them instead of emitting
separate global LLVM functions.

`each` is modeled as the first built-in block function: `1..9 -> each i { ... }`
means the range flows into `each` and the block is passed as its executable body.
`repeat` is the integer-count variant: `3 -> repeat turn { ... }` flows the count
into `repeat`, then invokes the block with `turn` values `1..3`. The common LLVM
emitter lowers these built-ins directly to LLVM basic blocks rather than
emitting a runtime closure, function pointer, or block-call dispatch.

Conditions follow the same flow style as block functions:
`condition -> if { ... } else { ... }` receives a `Bool` value on the left, and
`when { ... }` handles multi-branch value selection. When the same value is
tested in every arm, prefer `value -> when { >= limit { ... } else { ... } }` or
range arms such as `value -> when { 90..100 => ... else => ... }`; the subject
value is evaluated once and reused by the arm checks. Inside a one-input
function that uses the default `it` binding, subject-style `when` arms may omit
`it ->` entirely. Single-value arms may use `condition => value`; block arms
remain available for multi-statement bodies. Condition expressions lower to LLVM
branches and phi nodes, not runtime dispatch. The parser treats `true` and
`false` as `Bool` literals.

`fold` is the second built-in block function.
`1..100 -> fold 0 sum, i { sum + i }` lowers directly to LLVM loop blocks with
an SSA accumulator phi and returns the final accumulator value.

The `sys.io` module is implemented in Sollang under `stdlib/sys/io.slg`.
`stdlib/sys/runtime.slg` declares the lower `sys.runtime.*` intrinsic boundary.
These files use `namespace sys.io`, `namespace sys.runtime`, and
`import sys.runtime as rt` so the module body avoids repeated fully qualified
names. The compiler loads these standard library files before user code and
globally aliases `print`, `println`, and `readInt` to `sys.io.print`,
`sys.io.println`, and `sys.io.readInt`.

`start..endInclusive` creates an inclusive lazy `Range`, represented only by
its two bounds. `each` lowers a `Range` directly to a loop instead of allocating
an array. `beforeEach` and `afterEach` wrap each outer item's downstream work,
and `flatMap` visits its inner range without materializing pairs. Importing the
module exposes its public functions by both their short and qualified names:

```sollang
import std.sequence

2..9
    -> beforeEach outer { "$outer단" -> println }
    -> afterEach outer { println() }
    -> flatMap(1..9) outer, inner {
        "$outer × $inner"
    }
    -> each line {
        line -> println
    }
```

The interpolated value remains a deferred `Text` formatting plan through the
fused stream. Its holes are evaluated once at production time, and `each line`
passes the value to the buffered print sink without constructing a temporary
string for every row.

Range projections can select the Range-specific mapper while reusing generic
stream stages:

```sollang
import std.sequence

struct Reading {
    sensorId: Int
    celsius: Int
}

main {
    0 => alertCount!
    0 => scannedCount!

    1..1000000000
        -> map sensorId {
            Reading {
                sensorId: sensorId
                celsius: 20 + ((sensorId % 97) * 17) % 40
            }
        }
        -> tap reading {
            reading.sensorId => scannedCount!
        }
        -> filter reading {
            reading.celsius >= 57
        }
        -> take(5)
        -> each alert {
            alertCount! + 1 => alertCount!
            "alert $(alert.sensorId) = $(alert.celsius) C" -> println
        }

    "scanned=$(scannedCount!)" -> println
}
```

The library-defined `take` stage keeps its counter with `state name! = value` and uses
language-level `stop` to cancel the original Range loop. In this example, the
billion-element upper bound is never materialized or fully scanned.

State can also be a user struct. `scan(initial) accumulated, item { ... }`
updates one accumulator per input and emits every updated state. Its state type
is inferred from `initial`, so callers do not repeat generic type arguments.
Example `585-stream-transaction-risk-scan.slg` combines
`map -> tap -> scan -> filter -> take(5) -> each`; although its source range
contains one billion transaction IDs, upstream cancellation stops it after the
ninth ID.

A pipeline may also be stored as an affine `Stream<T>` and consumed later.
`defer` stores only the producer state, not its elements. Passing or returning
the stream uses `move`, and the final `each` consumes it exactly once:

```sollang
import std.sequence

makeValues values: Range -> Stream<Int> {
    values -> defer
}

main {
    1..6 -> makeValues => values
    values -> each value {
        "$value" -> println
    }
}
```

For hot native input, `sys.event.mouseEvents` returns an affine
`EventStream<MouseEvent>`. Its queue has a fixed capacity for its whole
lifetime and an explicit overflow policy. `stop` cancels and joins the producer
before restoring the console mode:

```sollang
import sys.event

main {
    32 -> event.mouseEvents(event.EventOverflowPolicy.CoalesceMotion) => events
    events -> each event {
        "mouse $(event.x),$(event.y)" -> println
        stop
    }
}
```

The adapter uses `ReadConsoleInputW` on Windows and SGR 1003/1006 terminal
events on Linux. Browser WebAssembly currently reports a targeted capability
diagnostic: blocking a browser main thread to pull a future DOM event would
prevent the event from being delivered. Browser support therefore requires a
separate host-driven callback lowering rather than a fake polling adapter.

When a formatted value must outlive immediate consumption, materialize it into
an explicit mutable `Arena` owner:

```sollang
formatLine value: Int, storage: mut Arena -> Text {
    "value=$value" -> materialize(storage)
}

main {
    Arena(0) => textStorage!
    42 -> formatLine(textStorage!) => line
    line -> println
}
```

`materialize` performs one arena allocation and returns an ordinary UTF-8
`Text` view. The compiler keeps the arena borrowed until the view's last use,
so growing, resetting, moving, or dropping `textStorage!` cannot invalidate
`line`. Immediate `println` pipelines remain allocation-free and do not need
an arena.

The same import also permits `sequence.flatMap`. If two imported modules expose
the same short name, the compiler asks for a qualified name or a module alias
instead of choosing silently. These are ordinary Sollang functions
rather than dedicated query syntax. A block function can declare and receive
multiple values, using `outer -> yield(inner)` to invoke `outer, inner { ... }`.

The grammar generator is intentionally narrow for the first language slice; it
validates the declared rules and produces the parser shape needed by the
approved syntax.

## Notes

This repository does not commit LLVM binaries or generated executables. The
compiler backend supports Windows x64, Linux x64, and browser WebAssembly.
When invoked from Windows, Linux linking uses WSL and requires a Linux `cc` in
the selected distribution; a packaged Linux compiler uses the native toolchain.
